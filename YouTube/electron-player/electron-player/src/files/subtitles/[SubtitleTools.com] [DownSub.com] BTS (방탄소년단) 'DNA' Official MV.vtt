WEBVTT

00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:47.682
At first sight I could recognize you

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:51.376
As if we were calling for each other

00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:55.096
The DNA in my blood vessel tells me

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:58.384
That it’s you I was looking all over for

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:02.144
Crossing our paths is like a formula of math

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:05.950
Commandments of religion, providence of the universe

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.332
The evidence of destiny given to me

00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:09.923
You’re the source of my dream

00:01:09.923 --> 00:01:11.064
Take it take it

00:01:11.064 --> 00:01:13.355
My hand reaching out to you is a fate decided

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:16.808
Don’t worry love

00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:20.578
All of this is not a coincidence

00:01:20.578 --> 00:01:24.223
We’re totally different baby

00:01:24.223 --> 00:01:27.847
Cuz we’re the two who found the destiny

00:01:27.847 --> 00:01:31.410
From the day of the unverse’s creation and on

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.630
through the infinite centuries and on

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.610
In the previous life and maybe the next too

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.455
We’re forever together

00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:50.575
All of this is not a coincidence

00:01:53.617 --> 00:01:57.450
Cuz we’re the two who found the destiny

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.014
DNA

00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:03.436
I want it this love I want it real love

00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:04.997
I only focus on you

00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:06.506
You steer me a little harder

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:10.639
The DNA of the genesis wants you

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.029
This is inevitable, I love us,

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:14.612
We are the only true lovers

00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:17.996
Every time I see her I freak out

00:02:17.996 --> 00:02:21.489
Surprisingly I keep gasping and it’s weird, maybe

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.659
This is the emotion they call love

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.884
Cuz from the very beginning my heart runs to you

00:02:28.884 --> 00:02:32.574
Don’t worry love

00:02:32.574 --> 00:02:36.230
All of this is not a coincidence

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.994
We’re totally different baby

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:43.596
Cuz we’re the two who found the destiny

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:47.329
From the day of the unverse’s creation and on

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.850
through the infinite centuries and on

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.446
In the previous life and maybe the next too

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:58.610
We’re forever together

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:05.971
All of this is not a coincidence

00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:13.021
Cuz we’re the two who found the destiny

00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:14.846
DNA

00:03:16.812 --> 00:03:20.595
Don’t look back

00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:24.078
Cuz we’re the ones who found the destiny

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:27.701
Don’t regret it baby

00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:28.653
Cuz we’re forever

00:03:28.653 --> 00:03:32.475
Forever

00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:35.425
Together

00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:39.175
Don’t worry love

00:03:39.175 --> 00:03:42.935
All of this is not a coincidence

00:03:42.935 --> 00:03:46.445
We’re totally different baby

00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:49.968
Cuz we’re the two who found the destiny

00:03:49.968 --> 00:03:51.349
DNA

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.373
La la la la la

00:03:54.373 --> 00:03:58.375
Cuz it’s not a coincidence

00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:01.907
La la la la la

00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:04.847
Cuz it’s not a coincidence
