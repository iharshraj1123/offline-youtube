WEBVTT

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.080
We were fighting just to “sound the alarm”

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.960
I just wanted to see you again, my beloved.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.220
Our world without strife,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.760
Was such a trivial thing

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.600
Who was it who said,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.770
We’d be better off in conflict?

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.710
the Day you laugh rough lie lie

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.130
give up – don’t say it, it’s out of the question!

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.800
Even if my mind falls into disarray,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.600
I still just can’t get enough!

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.480
There’s no resistance whatsoever, But isn’t that nice?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.020
We just want to become

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.570
deserving of the light.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.450
We’re living through this present day

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.160
We’re existing, believing that that day will eventually come!
