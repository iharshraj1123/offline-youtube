00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:24.140
Self-Inflicted Achromatic
(Jishou Mushoku)

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.820
I want to be someone like you.
(kimi no you na hito ni naritai na)

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.840
I want to be someone that feels very "me."
("boku rashii hito" ni naritai na)

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.680
If I want to, I can just go and do it.
(nozomu nara sousurya iikedo sa)

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.940
But then would that really be me?
(demo sorette honto ni boku nano kai)

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.100
One child's-play dream.
(kodomo damashi na yume hitotsu)

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.380
The way I am, someone like me is better off
(konna boku nara shineba ii no)

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.100
Dead.
(ni)

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.260
Where someone like me being alive
(konna boku ga ikiteru dake de)

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.020
Brings sadness to tens of thousands of people
(nan mannin no hito ga kanashin de)

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.740
And no one wants me:
(dare mo boku wo nozomanai)

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.900
I wish that's the kind of world it was.
(sonna sekai dattara ii no ni na)

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.100
If by just wiping me away
(konna boku ga kiechau dake de)

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.980
Hundreds of millions of people rejoiced
(nan okunin no hito ga yorokonde)

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.180
And no one held hatred for anything
(dare mo nani mo nikumanai nara)

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.140
Then I reject such a happy thing.
(sonna ureshii koto wa nai na)

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:44.140
Self-Inflicted Achromatic
(Jishou Mushoku)

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.420
Tomorrow, I'll still tread between reality and dreams.
(ashita mo boku wa yume utsutsu)

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.020
Just like that, I'd love to disappear.
(kono mama boku wa kiete ii no ni)

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.300
Where someone like me being alive
(konna boku ga ikita tokoro de)

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.020
Doesn't even register for hundreds of millions of people
(nan oku nin no hito wa shiranai shi)

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.020
And no one wants me:
(dare mo boku wo nozomanai)

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.020
If that were the world, would that be okay?
(sonna sekai dattara ii no kana)

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.140
Even if I were wiped away
(konna boku ga kieta tokoro de)

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.940
That wouldn't change some hundred million people.
(nan okunin no hito wa kawaranai)

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.300
If no one will resent me, then
(dare mo boku wo nikumanai nara)

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.940
The result's the same, a loss for me.
(son shita koto ni kawari nai na)

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.220
In the end, everyone collapses in the same manner.
(saigo nanka minna onaji you ni taorete yukimasu)

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.260
"My Self" made in others will crumble away.
(Made In tanin no "jibun jishin" kuzurete yukimasu)

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.540
In the end, everyone separates the same way—but—
(saigo nanka minna onaji you ni hanareteku no ni)

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.220
Just because I'm alive
(konna boku ga ikiteru dake de)

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.020
Why do you smile so much?
(nande kimi wa sonna ni warau no)

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.100
If you smile like that
(kimi ga sonna egao ja)

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.300
No matter how sad, how much I want to disappear—
(kanashikute mo kietakute mo)

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.780
If only all my reasons to say good-bye
(sayonara suru riyuu nante mou)

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.020
Went away.
(nakereba ii no ni)

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.100
Even if I were wiped away
(konna boku ga kieta tokoro de)

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.900
That wouldn't change some hundred million people.
(nan okunin no hito wa kawaranai)

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.420
But there's something preventing me
(dakedo boku wo tomeru nanika ga)

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.060
And showing me that face, I can't bear to laugh about it.
(sonna kao shicha waraenai ya)

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:32.060
Self-Inflicted Achromatic

Thank you very much.
