WEBVTT

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.860
Are you free tonight?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.080
Called from you, now

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.520
I’m clad in my favorite musk

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.680
and my sweet secrets.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.760
I’ve been waiting…

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.980
This weekend night!!

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.540
I’ll make this night my own,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.140
with everything I have.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.520
My libido is overflowing.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.040
Ah, how I love that urge.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.740
Well then, just watch as my last resort becomes the fast track to success.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.120
"Ahh… I might be a little drunk"

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I see through it all.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.620
Don’t show me some facade of composure.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.960
I see the true nature of it all.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.420
Let me do as I please.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.740
Come on, hurry, take me along.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.880
Close enough that our eyelashes could almost touch,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.480
I’ll steal even your thoughts and figure you out.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.900
It seems like I’ve said

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.300
more than I needed to.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.400
Please shut these sighing lips

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.200
with a kiss.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.280
I just Gimme×Gimme

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.820
Don’t think

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.220
about unnecessary things.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.860
Right now, let’s just dance.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.880
Shabadabada Dubidubidu

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.740
Like the end credits of a movie,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.580
the marks on my back piled up and increased in number.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.360
Drunk and pretending not to sober up,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.960
night comes upon us from a good evening.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.360
It’s perfect when it’s just not enough…

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.680
Don’t say such mean things!

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.020
It’s still not enough—this is pure love.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.520
Let me do as I please.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.820
Come on, hurry, take me along.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.840
Close enough that you could almost melt from the heat,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.480
I’ll steal even your thoughts and pierce right through you.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.960
It seems like I’ve said

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.180
more than I needed to.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
I’ll plug my ears

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.160
with your sighing lips.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.540
Stop this moment

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.700
and our breath.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.780
Fill the hole in my burning heart.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.040
Give me a reason to be here.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.320
I don’t care about the future,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.600
just look at me right now!

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.880
I just Wanna×Wanna

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.140
Let me do as I please.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.700
Come on, hurry, take me along.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.600
Close enough that our eyelashes could almost touch,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.420
I’ll steal even your thoughts and figure you out.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.840
It seems like I’ve said

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.100
more than I needed to.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.320
Please shut these sighing lips

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.020
with a kiss.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.880
Colored vibrantly,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.180
as if to light up this world.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.760
Until I’ve had my fill of body heat,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.460
please shut these sighing lips

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.460
with a kiss.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.300
don't want to go home

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.540
but I have to

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.760
because he comes home

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.120
Maybe next time
