"Mousou Sketch (Delusion Sketch)"
Music and Lyrics by 40mP

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.320
If it's too much to handle, it's better to not have enough

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.860
I tease you with a devoted love

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.340
Even if it's not cursed, it's safer not to touch it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.840
I beg you, praying with all my soul

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.640
Lying tears of rain

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.880
Spill from the sky, and fall upon cold cheeks

00:00:50.880 --> 00:01:00.840
In the withered sea of my heart, a single flower came into bloom

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.400
If deception isn't particularly difficult

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.900
Believing can't be either, can it?

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.620
It's best not to even think of looking back

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.340
So just for now, please do deceive me

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.860
If you've gotten filthy, it's better not to know

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.360
I want to dream, of a delusional love

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.860
If someone leaves you, it's safer not to chase them

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.340
Don't make excuses, and don't be so sentimental

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.160
The scenic town comes alive

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.420
With people clamoring, and I run away feigning deafness

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.060
As long as no one tells me

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.400
"You're the odd one out"

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.920
If being correct isn't particularly difficult

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.460
Erring can't be either, can it?

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.120
Before we trade answers, tell me this:

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.220
Is that answer of yours right?

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.040
Since I'm muttering only petty lies

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.620
There's no reason to hate me, is there?

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.300
I'm fine with a love back-to-back,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.960
So promptly, please do warm me up
