00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.160
I’m getting on the bus to the other world, see ya!

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.640
"I’m Getting on the Bus to the Other World, See Ya!"

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.140
I can’t count the lives I ruined when I was young,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.400
I’d smile as I bury another life before heading home

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.280
Looking back now, I should've been the first one to die.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.840
So cheerful despite the gloomy atmosphere

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.500
I've lost my will to live

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.760
Life is just needlessly long

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.800
Nothing but meaningless wrinkles and creases

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.280
My heart pointlessly laments this hopeless take on life

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.980
Spitting out ideals that just hurt my ears!

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.860
What value is there to a life that wants to end?

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.600
Am I just being selfish?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.060
I don’t even know what to think!

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.900
In the end, after a few years I’ll just be a nuisance.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.400
So stab me, kill me, and take me away

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.040
I’m getting on the bus to the other world, see ya!

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.280
I still remember all the times I was made fun of as a kid

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.480
These unreasonable thoughts that I don’t even remember thinking just won’t go away

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.820
Looking back now, how did I just swallow the pain?

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.260
Ah, if only I had fought back...

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.920
Sulking about in a hazy crowd of people

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.380
Displaying a life that seems worth living

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.700
The “theory of happiness” is uselessly deep

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.620
Just some words that don’t serve any purpose

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.340
My shallow heart is driven by an uneasy, fretful rush

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.000
Nothing but time passes, and it can never come back...

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.840
What takes root in life just makes me want to disappear

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.520
You say I’m a nuisance?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.980
No one asked for your opinion!

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.780
In the end, after a few years it’ll just be the same thing...

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.540
So stab me, kill me, and take me away

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.020
Is there any meaning to life if you want it to end?

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.000
Are there any dreams seen in a life that wants to end?

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.180
There are none

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.880
What value is there to a life that wants to end?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.780
“That must suck.”

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.020
“I get it."

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.060
Don’t act as if you understand!

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.740
In the end, after a few years, I’ll still be suffering

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.640
So stab me, kill me, and take me away

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.940
This is the only thing I thought to do

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.040
My first and final struggle in vain…

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.340
I’m getting on the bus to the other world, see ya!

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.460
And yet, I regret, and scream as the rain falls...
