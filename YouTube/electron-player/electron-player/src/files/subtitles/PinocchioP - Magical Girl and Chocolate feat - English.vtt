Magical Girl and Chocolate

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.831
I'll wear a cute costume

00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:19.592
And shine in a pose

00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:22.324
Turn my pure feelings into magic

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.357
I’ll wish peace for everyone

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.000
And stand up to the evil

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.095
That, the anonymous dissed

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.088
"You're really XXX, aren't you?"

00:00:30.088 --> 00:00:31.711
“To be honest, you’re XXX, aren't you?"

00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:33.004
Because that's what you believe,

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:34.883
You want everyone to be XXX, don't you

00:00:34.883 --> 00:00:36.671
With a worn-out,

Common rumor

I want to quit being a magical girl (sigh)

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.169
Selfish

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:19.658
My magic is boiling over

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.288
The potion mixed with dissatisfaction goes

00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:22.860
Poof

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.527
"You're all XXX, right?”

00:01:24.527 --> 00:01:26.136
"You’re all XXX deep inside, right?”

00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:29.303
I’m so angry, I’ll XXX you all in my head

00:01:29.303 --> 00:01:31.111
Retaliation is nonsense,

00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:32.828
Don't let it bother me

00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:36.369
A brooch that lost its light

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:38.366
I'm rotting, I'm rotting

Aren’t you waiting for everyone to say “please don’t quit”?

The good-intentioned XXX

00:02:08.832 --> 00:02:11.187
And the worrying XXX of my fans

00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:14.668
XXXXX!!

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:17.925
