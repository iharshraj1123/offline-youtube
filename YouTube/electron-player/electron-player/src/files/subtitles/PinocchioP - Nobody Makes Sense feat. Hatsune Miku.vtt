00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
"Nobody Makes Sense"

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000
The night is dawning. I wake up 
in the morning. I hurt my neck.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.500
There is my own self residing 
within this body. I talk to you. I eat breakfast.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.000
I put on clothes. All of that feels uncanny.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.500
Something’s weird. It’s weird, it’s weird, it’s weird. 
I pass through the ticket gate.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.500
Everything’s so peaceful, so peaceful, 
so peaceful, so naturally peaceful, it’s almost funny.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000
Cats are usually called Tama, for no particular reason.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Dogs are usually called Pochi, for no particular reason.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.500
The world, the world seems to be on the verge of ending, for no particular reason.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.000
I’m melting into the afterglow 
while carrying my own existence.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.500
For what are we living? For what are we trying so hard?

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.000
There might be nothing, nothing, nothing to it. 
It might be all useless.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
In a thousand years, there won’t be anything left, 
but I still hope I could keep on smiling with you,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
because nobody makes sense. Nobody makes sense.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.500
The moon is rising. The stars are shining. 
The bugs are hopping. I’m looking at that.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.500
Huh? How long have I been here for? 
How much longer can I remain here?

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.500
Unable to become anyone of consequence,  
all I’m doing is running away from monsters.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
Conjuring the mental picture inside my own prison, I find my blocked trains of thought filled with enemies

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Even now, the name of the first son is still Tarō,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.500
but nowadays, the name of the second son is Hanako.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.500
Time, time just somehow passes by

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.500
as I gaze at the starry sky, 
all the while buried in a garbage dump.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.000
For what do we love? For what do our hearts race?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There might be nothing, nothing, nothing to it. 
It might be all a lie.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.500
I’m not even sure what is 1+1, but still, 
I want to keep protecting you,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
because nobody makes sense.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.000
Nobody makes sense.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.000
Even then, we still catch our breath 
when passing through a tunnel.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We still fold paper cranes. 
We still touch the paws of our pets.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.000
We still step only on the 
white parts of the zebra crossings.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.500
Even then, we still do things that are wrong. 
We’re still bent on thinking that it’s right.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.000
We’re smart, that’s why we knew it.
Again, we think to ourselves that we get it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.500
For what are we living? For what are we trying so hard? 
There might be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing to it.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.000
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing to it. 
But even so, there’s no choice but to do it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
For what are we living? For what are we trying so hard?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.500
There might be nothing, nothing, nothing to it.
It might be all useless.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.500
In a thousand years, there won’t be anything left,
but I still hope I could keep on smiling with you.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.500
Even when our dreams have come true; 
even when we have become enlightened, 
in the end, we might still end up with loneliness.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.500
Even when we’ve turned into ghosts; 
even when we’ve returned to nothingness,
I still hope I could keep on smiling with you,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.500
Because nobody makes sense. 
Because nobody makes sense.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.000
That’s right, nobody makes sense.
That’s right, nobody makes sense.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
That’s right, nobody makes sense. 
That’s right, because nobody makes sense.
