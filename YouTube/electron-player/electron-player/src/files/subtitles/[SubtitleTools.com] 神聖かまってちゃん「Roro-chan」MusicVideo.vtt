Shinsei Kamattechan - Ruru's Livestream Suicide Show

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.700 line:-2
On my way home, without friends

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.440 line:-2
The sunset is sometimes kind

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.320 line:-2
Amidst the data flying around

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.000 line:-2
The city's Bluetooth destroyed me

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.280 line:-2
Jumping into the Chūō Line

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.900 line:-2
Being called a nuisance

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.200 line:-2
She was always there

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.780 line:-2
The girl went ahead and died

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.000 line:-2
Even if you ask the FBI

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500 line:-2
You'll never know her message

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.120 line:-2
She was always shouting

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.320 line:-2
channeling to widen the night sky

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.140 line:-2
I waltzed with a stray cat

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.820 line:-2
Amidst the data flying around

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.860 line:-2
The city's Bluetooth destroyed me

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.920 line:-2
Jumping onto a UFO

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.700 line:-2
It's not a phase mom, please listen

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.180 line:-2
She was always alone

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.340 line:-2
The girl went ahead and died

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.640 line:-2
Even if you ask the FBI

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.100 line:-2
You'll never know her message

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.940 line:-2
She was always shouting

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.940 line:-2
When I'm done studying for entrance exams

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.500 line:-2
I'm a witch that talks with cats

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.700 line:-2
I'll do a livestream suicide show and build a grave

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.640 line:-2
Before this terrible feeling dissappears

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.880 line:-2
Jumping into the Chūō Line

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.660 line:-2
Being called a nuisance

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.960 line:-2
She was always there

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.160 line:-2
The girl went ahead and died

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.680 line:-2
Looking down upon stupid humans

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.120 line:-2
With the cats on a roof

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.560 line:-2
She was always shouting

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.160 line:-2

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.540 line:-2

Being called a nuisance

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.240 line:-2
She was always there

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.640 line:-2
The girl went ahead and died

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.460 line:-2
Even if you ask the FBI

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.220 line:-2
You'll never know her message

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.900 line:-2
She was always shouting

Ruru's Livestream Suicide Show

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.240 line:-2
Those humans...

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.480 line:-2
They're so stupid

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.060 line:-2
Those humans...

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.920 line:-2
They're so stupid
