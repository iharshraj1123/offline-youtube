"Durarara"
【Complications】

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:15.000
The low sky grieves with a face that's about to cry

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.230
I spit them out, mixed with my irritation

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.460
Fearing a tomorrow where everything is about to shatter

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Just looking at tomorrow won't bring me an answer

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.100
I already know that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.200
a tomorrow of infinitely many possibilities that fades into the white

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.800
what I take it for

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.800
a tomorrow that's reality is stained in pure black

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.240
what I see it as

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.780
I struggle and shine

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.500
a tomorrow of possibilities that spread into pure white infinity

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
what I see in it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.400
a tomorrow that's reality is painted in pure black

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.000
what I think of it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.680
I struggle and shine
