00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.960
My whole life boiled down to a sheet of B4 paper

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.860
Hoping someone will accept me, I smile

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.380
A twisted problem that defies calculation

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.240
And I can't go out and play till it's solved

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.760
Others are so far ahead, I'm left behind

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.980
Just longing for what's beyond these tracks

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.720
Oh well

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.740
I don't know what I want to do

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.580
I don't know what I can do

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.100
Repeating this over and over

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.500
I've dragged myself this far

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.160
I don't know about tomorrow

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.660
I can't change yesterday

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.020
Just let me have today

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.600
My life hinges on a few lines of "good luck"

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.840
I walk around handing it out in pieces, pushing it on people

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.360
No one expects much of me, and neither do I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.620
What will we look like after we're all worn down?

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.920
What did I get for all this?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.140
What did I lose in all this?

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.640
Looking for an answer

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.140
I've made it this far gritting my teeth

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.740
The world may end tomorrow

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.220
I may forget about yesterday

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.420
Just let me have today

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.440
Others are so far ahead, I'm left behind

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.280
"Where did I get tripped up?"

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.120
"Hey, what was I doing?"

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.860
No one expects much of me, I expect nothing

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.260
We're worn down, but we're still breathing

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.600
But I don't know what I want to do

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.640
I don't know what I can do

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.160
Repeating this over and over

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.400
I've dragged myself this far

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.400
I don't know about tomorrow

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.880
I can't change yesterday

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:03.180
Just let us have today, this moment
