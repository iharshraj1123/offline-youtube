00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.380
You're a useless, useless, useless child

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.980
The most useless child in the entire world

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.180
You Are a Useless Child

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.780
Music and lyrics: Kikuo

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:25.127
La la la

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:28.980
Studying, athletics, speaking,
you can't do anything

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.900
You're a poor, dimwitted, grimy brat

00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:35.761
Your mouth can't form your own name,

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:40.362
but I like the sobs it made

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:43.920
Covered in drool, snot, dandruff, shit and piss

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.940
You tainted, crybaby, coward
I don't mind, don't mind

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.380
Come here, let me protect you

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.600
together, together, together with me

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.780
La la, 
A lullaby and goodnight

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.000
Let's sing a duet, a sleepy-sounding song

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.180
Let's sing it, 
Sing it together with me...

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.340
Oh lonely child, child

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.300
You're a useless, useless, useless child

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.880
The most useless child in the entire world

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.580
You're a useless, useless, useless child

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.640
If it weren't for me, you would be a dead child

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.980
You're a useless, useless, useless child

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.880
a sad, sad good-for-nothing

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.820
You're a useless, useless, useless child

00:01:36.702 --> 00:01:41.800
I will be the one to help you

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:51.589
La la la

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:55.020
You're a monster, ghost, invisible human,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.940
Urinal ornament,
rejected from school

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.702
Whispered gossip from dry mouths.

00:02:02.702 --> 00:02:06.460
Let’s listen to that monotone scream.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.265
Nevertheless time goes on and on

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:13.515
You don't have enough brains nor time, child

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:17.280
It’s too late, 
you’re mentally retarded

00:02:17.563 --> 00:02:21.246
Oh sweet child, good child, you belong to me.

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:25.260
La la, 
A lullaby and goodnight

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.045
Sleepily, together with me,

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:33.780
Let's dance, dance,
Let's dance forever oh lonely...

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.660
child, child,
child, child

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.680
You're a useless, useless, useless child

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.860
The most useless child in the entire world

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.905
You are a lonely, lonely, lonely child

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.660
I will protect you forever

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.860
But I can't catch that child

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.020
the child ran away from my side

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.906
Before I knew it, that child was covered in wounds

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.040
Even so, just like that, the child departed

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.060
child, child
child, child

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.629
I’m a useless, useless, useless child

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.500
That useless child is no longer here

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.720
I’m a useless, useless, useless child

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.280
Nobody helps me anymore

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.160
I'm a lonely, lonely, lonely child

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.660
There is no lonely child anymore

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.140
I'm a lonely, lonely, lonely child

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.420
If only I could turn back the time

00:04:12.236 --> 00:04:16.962
You're a Useless Child
