00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.630
Even if I cover my ears, even if I close my eyes

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.670
Every little thing seeps in through my pores

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.730
Too many rumors and talk of terrible things

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.860
I stopped thinking about them

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.740
And I pray for other's misfortune

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.660
My fingers speak more than my lips

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.790
Whatever's inside that head of yours

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.710
It wasn't you who packed it

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.730
You gotta go where? He got to where?

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.030
Now that we've all lost our heads

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.080
We're doomed to wander the darkness aimlessly

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.000
Now that we've all lost our identities

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.380
Please tell us the meaning of love

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.590
Whoa whoa whoa, with our own arms

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.890
Whoa whoa whoa, let's take it all back
