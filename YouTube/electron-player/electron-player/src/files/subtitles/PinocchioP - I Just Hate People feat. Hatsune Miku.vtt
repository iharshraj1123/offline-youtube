WEBVTT

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.860
A new religion is uncovered, a new hero

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.520
The distribution of candy and drugs, BRAINWASH

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.300
Everyone's hearts throb with a smile

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.340
A holocaust for my dear you

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.520
An epigone, gone mad in copulation

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.460
A line of trade secrets, fallen in a ditch

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.040
Widening understanding, after abnegation

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.200
The result, is a corpse

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.360
"Welcome, come back soon," said to the soil

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.800
A complete denial of others is cool! ><

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.460
God-sama, Whatever-sama, Buddha-sama, please be gentle TONIGHT☆

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.160
O usual fit, thy name is Munchausen's syndrome

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.920
One for All, All for woof woof woof! I love dogs!

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.340
I love cats! I love you! But still…

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.480
I Just Hate People！！

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.680
I Just Hate People！！

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.580
A nation that sends a hole straight through your cranium

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.420
A whore saw a U・F・O

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.260
Mental Illness incurable by orthodontic

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
You're not scary, you scapegoat, so come here

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.220
Jumping into the sky with a negative ion,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.220
a zero-sum game without insurance

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.220
To the cry of mad truth

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.580
No one wants to listen

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.520
Let's sing a quiet boom

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.400
Let's dance with the Burnham effect

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.240
Let's eat, burdened with glory

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.500
A group of false idols

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.560
Welcome to everyone who is listening to this song

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.100
I guarantee public peace and spiritual benefit, just kidding!

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.600
God-sama, Whatever-sama, Buddha-sama, please show me the DREAM☆

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.380
Is the work schedule on this spaceship cutting corners?

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.020
One for All, All for woof woof woof! Let's be dogs!

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.300
Let's be cats! Let's be you! But still…

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.620
I don't want to be human!!

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.600
Hey there（Hey there）

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.420
Do I have a chance of salvation?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.420
Hey there（Hey there）

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.200
Why is my upbringing full of scars?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.820
Hey there（Hey there）

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.580
And are useless things really no good, really useless?

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.260
Hey there, hey there, tell me

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.880
God-sama, Whatever-sama, Buddha-sama, please be gentle TONIGHT☆

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.140
Your earlier seizure has been diagnosed as Munchausen's syndrome

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.980
Though you're useless, since you're useless, useless in your own way, bring me a DREAM☆

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.060
Is the work schedule on this spaceship cutting corners?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.420
One for All, All for woof woof woof! I love dogs!

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.620
I love cats! I love you! But still…

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.620
I Just, I Just, I Just

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.400
I Just, I Just, I Just

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.800
Hate People！！
