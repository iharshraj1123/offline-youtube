00:00:00.916 --> 00:00:02.199
What is rightness? 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:03.703
What is stupidity?

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:07.575
 I will show you what they are

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:19.200
I was an honor student being young

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.050
Before I realized, I was already grown up

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.686
A train of thought like a knife

00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:26.686
Which I didn’t have that with me 

00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:28.309
But I’m not having enough fun 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:29.853
Something is missing  

00:00:29.853 --> 00:00:32.644
These troubles better be somebody’s fault

00:00:32.644 --> 00:00:36.661
I’m just confused errday

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.134
Well, is that so?

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:40.699
Understanding the latest trends

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.459
Checking stock market on my way to work

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:46.208
Joining a company with pure spirit

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:49.547
These are the obvious rules for us workers

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.694
Huh??

00:00:51.694 --> 00:00:54.080
Shut up, shut up, shut the f*** up!

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.704
I’m healthier than you think 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.696
You are too mediocre to understand me, perhaps  

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:04.367
Ah, you are so perfect match to 

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:07.800
Those ordinary melodies of yours

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.400
Shut up, shut up, shut the f*** up! 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.590
I deal things differently so no problem at all!

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.970
Yeah, I’m an exemplary person

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.764
So “no thanks” to actually punching someone

00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:36.394
If I’ll point my muzzle of words to your head and fire 

00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:38.701
Wouldn’t that be so crazy? I can’t stop

00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:41.731
Complaining and complaining til you die

00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:45.079
My spirit becomes sadistic

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:47.000
I’m f***ing tired

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.690
Pour drinks when glasses are empty

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.232
Take off the skewer so it’s easier for everyone to eat

00:01:52.232 --> 00:01:54.819
Check and order before anyone does

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.989
These are the minimum rules for social manner

00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:00.623
Huh??

00:02:00.623 --> 00:02:02.621
Shut up, shut up, shut the f*** up!

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:05.750
Close your stinking mouth, I can’t stand it

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.500
I am the modern spokesperson

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.948
I’m fed up with

00:02:12.948 --> 00:02:16.450
Those rehash parody of yours

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.278
Shut up, shut up, shut the f*** up!

00:02:19.278 --> 00:02:23.150
Draw an X on your fat face

00:02:34.156 --> 00:02:37.098
Shut up, shut up, shut the f*** up!

00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:42.000
Shut up, shut up, shut the f*** up!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.771
I’m your so-called genius

00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:47.576
Shut up, shut up, shut the f*** up!

00:02:47.576 --> 00:02:50.291
I’m healthier than you think

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:55.800
You are too mediocre to understand me, perhaps

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.000
Ah, so boring

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.107
How many times do I have to listen to those memories of yours

00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:03.902
Shut up, shut up, shut the f*** up!

00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:07.650
I know I’m not a big deal either, but I don’t care

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.250
No problem at all
