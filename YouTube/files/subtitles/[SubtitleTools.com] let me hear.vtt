00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.800
You guys do not notice that we are gifted just by being humans

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.630
We are absolute predators

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.649
We do not even have any enemies

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:24.563
Maybe there are other animals watching us

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:35.000
and thinking that someday âwe will beat them downâ

00:00:39.126 --> 00:00:41.567
Oh We have the brains to think hard

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:44.035
Wear our favorite clothes

00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:47.933
We are at no doubt human beings

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.510
Many small lives

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.600
They were born

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.100
with the fate

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.530
of dying for someone

00:00:55.614 --> 00:00:57.757
A human baby

00:00:57.757 --> 00:01:00.628
When will they find out

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.300
that at the point they were born, we are

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.300
winners of Earth

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:18.500
aa hitori naiteita tonari no kimi ga toikakeru

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:28.010
dakara bokura yorisoi ikiru kirameku made

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.450
For what have I been living forï¼

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.100
When will I find out the answerï¼

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.900
An answer that is only for you

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.090
What will myself and (the) first scenery I saw

00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:39.308
Look likeï¼

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.000
It's my face, my face

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.990
Shut up! I read this inside the book I read before

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:53.807
According (to) Maslow

00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:57.634
There are five steps (in a) human's desire

00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:00.986
To live a long long life to stay safe and to receive

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:03.610
love from others

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.498
To get respect from

00:02:04.922 --> 00:02:06.585
others, To get closer

00:02:07.158 --> 00:02:08.251
to your ideal

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.131
That's what it said

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.028
No matter how hard other animals try,

00:02:15.028 --> 00:02:16.951
they probably can't go over the first step

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.400
That is how intelligent we are and, (an animal) filled with greed

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.820
But that is probably why we can still live

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.200
on the top of the food chain

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.280
in this blue planet although we have weak bodies

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:51.600
aa mata kimi no me ni itsumo no asa ga utsurikomu

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:58.388
nagareru namida ga kieteyuku

00:02:58.388 --> 00:03:00.396
For what to live for

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:05.112
Think deeply as you live yeah

00:03:05.112 --> 00:03:09.934
Cuz you humans are (the) only ones that can do this on Earth

00:03:09.934 --> 00:03:15.243
atarashii kotae o

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.420
What is it that you want to get in your right hands?

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.084
Let me hear

00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:24.170
Tell me your new answer

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.000
Prove that you are different from monkies

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.250
If there is nothing to crave for, humans will die in a way

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.100
Don't you think so tooï¼

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:39.510
Let me hear, Let me hear, Let me hear
