00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.960
How to Eat Life​
​(Inoti no Tabekata)​

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.920
A backpacker, who is searching for something missing​,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.500
flew into a rage yet again​

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.240
​​​Even if I were to get hopeful over sudden happenings​

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.900
you wouldn't appear at all​

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.100
"Bibbidi Bobbide Bouー"

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920
Reciting it just like a spell,​

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.320
but I'm still anxiously waiting for its return​

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.380
Yet again those emotions escaped me​

00:00:46.387 --> 00:00:47.221
(It isn't this,)​

00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:47.980
(nor that)​

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.960
(This is just making me more impatient)​

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.160
All I wanted was a hand next to me to hold​

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.100
because I don't know the warmth of it at all​

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.900
This poverty have reached my heart​

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.160
while wandering around the gray sea​

00:01:04.372 --> 00:01:06.841
The beauty of it is overflowing​

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:08.000
Do not overlook it​

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.000
Tonight,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.740
​before tomorrow comes, sober up

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.800
You're running out of time

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.480
I want to be blinded​

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:20.221
​from this dull today​

00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:21.920
and go beyond it​

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.620
Surelyー

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.480
Your voice

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.994
has yet to hit and make all these thoughts go away

00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:29.263
until I get overcome with unsteadiness

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.780
For both of us,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.500
To forget that is unforgivable.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.000
As long as you don’t ever stop thinking of it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.300
The Mad Hatter that dances at midnight​

00:01:47.314 --> 00:01:48.849
vanishes before you could say a thing​

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:50.684
Even if I were to lower my expectations​

00:01:50.684 --> 00:01:52.085
you wouldn't appear at all​

00:01:52.953 --> 00:01:54.522
Crying in the gap between reality​

00:01:54.522 --> 00:01:56.220
my stomach being torn apart with this thought​

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.700
The thorns of the words I've gulped down stab me​

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.760
Only that absurdity was left over​

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.597
(My favorite)​

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.560
(cutlery)​

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.120
(seems to bring only bliss)​

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.680
Everyone was gathering around the table​

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.700
just to thrust forward the knife​

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.360
while tearing out your adam's apple​

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.520
I wet the tips of my fingers​

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.018
How to use a fork​

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:27.220
No one has ever taught me

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.780
Do not try to look at the truth​

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.860
Measuring the weight of life

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.560
In that wavering bonfire,​

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.720
what did you see?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.700
Tonight,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.660
​​before tomorrow comes, sober up

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.440
You're running out of time

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.700
I want to be blinded from this dull today​

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.172
and go beyond it​

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.000
Surelyー

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.100
My voice

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.640
has yet to hit and make all these thoughts go away

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.420
until I get overcome with unsteadiness

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.620
For both of us,

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.100
To forget that is unforgivable.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.780
As long as you don’t ever stop thinking of it

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.860
Find me,​

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.300
before I eat myself​
