NOTE generated by youtube-vtt https://github.com/benwiley4000/youtube-vtt

1
00:00:01.655 --> 00:00:07.500
Like a cruel angel,

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.400
young boy, become a legend!

3
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.000
A blue wind is now 
knocking at the door to your heart,

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and yet you are merely gazing at me

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and smiling.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Something gently touches

7
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.000
you're so intent on seeking it out,

8
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that you can't even see your fate yet,

9
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
with such innocent eyes.

10
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But someday I think you'll find out 
that what's on your back

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
are wings that are for 
heading for the far-off future.

12
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.000
The cruel angel's thesis

13
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
will soon take flight through the window,

14
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.000
with surging hot pathos,

15
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.000
if you betray your memories.

16
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.300
Embracing this universe and shining,

17
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.400
young boy, become a legend!

18
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.000
Sleeping for a long time

19
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
in the cradle of my love

20
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.000
The morning is coming when you alone will be called

21
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.000
by a messenger of dreams.

22
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Moonlight reflects off 
the nape of your slender neck.

23
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.000
Stopping time all throughout the world

24
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.000
I want to confine them, but...

25
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So if two people being brought together by fate 
has any meaning,

26
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I think that it is a "bible" 
for learning freedom.

27
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.000
The cruel angel's thesis.

28
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.000
The sorrow then begins.

29
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.000
You held tight to the form of life

30
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.000
when you woke up from that dream.

31
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.000
You shine brighter than anyone else.

32
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.000
Young boy, become a legend!

33
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.000
People create history 
while weaving love.

34
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.500
Even knowing I'll never be a goddess 
 or anything like that, I live on.

35
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The cruel angel's thesis

36
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.000
will soon take flight through the window,

37
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.000
with surging hot pathos,

38
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.000
if you betray your memories.

39
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.000
Embracing this universe and shining,

40
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.000
young boy, become a legend!
