00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.920
Slow-motion

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.860
things just gradually go on changing

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.480
Having dropped by the convenience store to grab a bento

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.560
I was in my room just watching TV

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.580
Having come to compromise as for the answer to the question

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.480
I’ll keep playing the fool who answers with wild fantasies

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.520
Having broken out in a fever and gulped down some medicine

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.400
I was sleeping tucked into my futon

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.520
Your stupid face suddenly popped into my head

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.020
Stuck in a feverish daze thinking “I’m not ready to die just yet.”

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.060
Wearing that smug, self-satisfied face in your teens

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.000
Learning the meaning of shame and embarrassment in your 20s

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.920
Finally getting the full measure of yourself in your 30s

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.960
That’s all part and parcel of one’s human experience

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.500
Breaking into a sweat and changing my pyjamas,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.100
The clock strikes 12

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.920
This song has been going on for about a minute,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.720
How long has it been since you were born?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.540
Slow-motion

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.380
from cradle to the grave

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.540
Stuck with a wildly fluctuating manic-depressive condition

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.940
Wanting to make at least a single ideal romantic connection,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.560
But trying too hard at that whole communication thing is bound to backfire

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.620
Continually auditioning all comers while that aesthetic sense continues to dull with age

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.520
You’re not the only one with a life full of regrets

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.380
It'll be okay

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.480
Tinkering with the parts to suit your current tastes

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.440
Figuring out just what you gotta do is love

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500
The past, present and future

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.520
all blend together in the depths of the night

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.500
This cough is giving me fits, I chugged some water

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.520
With a deep breath I lapsed back into thought

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.420
Battling a runny nose, I prayed for harmony and inner peace

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.140
But a single sneeze and I can kiss that enlightenment goodbye

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.020
My old self, the one that could laugh with nary a worry

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.980
Who wouldn’t cry over a few bumps in the road

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.000
Now with a smile worn down by the sands of time,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.080
I’m well on pace for my wrinkle-filled finale

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.600
While changing the towel on my forehead,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.080
I realized it’s only two-something in the morning

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.980
This song has got about 2 more minutes left in it

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.160
How much of your lifespan do you have left?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.180
Graduation

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.940
the capstone of those years of toil,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.040
Perfectly partitioned, that hatred and backstabbing kept just out of sight

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.340
I’d like to say that except for a few essential things, I don’t really care to remember all that happened…

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.900
As for my imagination, a life-time of sensory overload has mostly ground in to dust

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.100
Don’t get me started on religion, a pile of blind, preconceived notions

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.160
Even if you try and go out in style with a funny portrait on your casket, haters are gonna hate

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.620
And that’s just the way it is

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.700
Writhing and wriggling about

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.400
Stuck in this spot where everything once familiar has quite steadily slipped away

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.500
Even when caught in the grip of this sentimental self-reflection

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.680
“Achoo! Achoo!” This sneezing still makes me look pretty dumb

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.780
“Sniffle, Sniffle” This stuffy nose-whistle of mine,

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.420
It serves as a sign of the approaching dawn

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.980
Slow-motion,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.040
morning comes and my fever falls

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.060
A glance out of the window reveals a “clear blue sky”-type condition

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.520
Reflecting back on it all, should I just go with the flow and casually give up the ghost right now?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.920
Slow-motion, even idols can’t fight Father Time for long

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.100
They hit the variety show circuit and eventually turn to dust like everyone else

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.380
The beginning and end of life slowly tied together, it’s such a strange and wondrous occurrence

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.820
It’s a combination of things, I mean, sure you want to meet the “right” person

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.100
But the true question is: “What is “right”, really?”

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.540
A life full of regrets and embarrassment, missteps abound, that’s for sure

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.120
Cleaned out till you’re empty inside,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.800
that’s par for the course I’d say

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.820
It'll be okay

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.780
I think

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:58.180
Slow-motion…

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.540
Everything just slowly moving towards that final curtain drop
