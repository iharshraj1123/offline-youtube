00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.110
It must be that there are more beautiful things
than what you’re not able to forget

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.580
It must be that there are more beautiful things
than what you’re not able to forget

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.150
Just forgetting everything
is not beautiful

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.550
It must be that life isn’t
all about its sad times

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.980
Yet it will always
be compared with joy

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.880
Ship, oh ship, you never got taken away 
midst the rough waves

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.010
The time I spent in my youth with you
is rooted deep within the water, but

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.250
that anchor needed 
to be lifted when the time came for us

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.180
to part

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.550
I fold my fingers counting my wounds 
and the pain I went through

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.010
The one pinky left standing 
must be from my affection for you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.450
There will be painful times,
and some are your fault

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.550
Yet your red string of fate
is entangled somewhere, isn’t it?

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.850

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.010
It must not be that you fear
only the things that are still yet unknown

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.510
You don’t envy
only the things you can’t reach

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.850
It must be that being kind
 is not the only way to be kind

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.280
Yet being unembellished
feels a little unpleasant

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.180
Wings, oh wings, wishing to reach the standards,
and getting held back by the crowds

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.250
Everyone aimed to get to that place
during our youthful days that still had conflicts

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.550
This fever distances me
from the innocent

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.450
days

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.910
Fixing my hair length, 
re-painting the tips of my nails

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.380
Making even my innocent lips
seem lit up

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.780
Some wishes will come true,
there will also be people whose wishes don’t come true

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.480
That must be why
I can’t help but console

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.610
Wings, oh flowers,
scatter on the surface of the water

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.680

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.880
I fold my fingers counting my wounds
and the pain I went through

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.350
The one pinky left standing
must be from my affection for you

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.780
There will be times I’ll curse,
and some are my fault

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.110
I’ll someday manage to cut away
this red string of fate

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.610
Give whispers to the petals
and a kiss out of pity

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.050
Only when you’re able to look back on something 
as a nostalgic memory, do you finally get over it

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.410
There will be confusing times,
but that’s not anyone’s fault

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.150
It’s quite a difficult task

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.010
to love someone isn’t it

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.180
