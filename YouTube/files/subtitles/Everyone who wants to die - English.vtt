00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.690
Illustrator : ぬごですが。

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.540
Instrumental : Eem Triplin

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.410
Song : Takayan

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.090
"To everyone who wants to die"

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.240
To everyone, who is trying their best to keep on breathing.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.250
I hope you’ll be able to live freely forever.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.620
The single voice,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.590
that supports you from the back.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.250
Not those sentences such as “Cheer up.”

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.150
It’s the grace from

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.950
“I’m with you.”

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.150
It’s okay.  You can cry like you are dying.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.750
When you get furious,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.050
just let it out.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.150
You are the protagonist.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.020
Uniqueness will come up eventually.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.790
Just live, without pushing yourself too hard.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.610
Even if no one understands you,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.050
Your “love”

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.550
is the source of your happiness, isn’t it?

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.050
Keep on chasing after it,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.390
Failure is also a lesson to learn, isn’t it?

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.990
Nobody has the right

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.720
to deny your values.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.990
Nobody can criticize

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.550
your will to die or give up.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.420
But if it makes you suffer, quit it.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.550
At that time, you don’t need to act strong,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.220
just get sick about it.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.120
Thanks for still living.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.050
I hope I can be with you tomorrow, too.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.250
To everyone, who is trying their best to keep on breathing.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.220
I hope you’ll be able to live freely forever.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.590
The single voice,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.550
that supports you from the back.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.220
Not those sentences such as “Cheer up.”

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.120
It’s the grace from

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.920
“I’m with you.”

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.120
It’s okay.  You can cry like you are dying.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.720
When you get furious,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.020
just let it out.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.120
You are the protagonist.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.990
Uniqueness will come up eventually.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.750
Just live, without pushing yourself too hard.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.040
