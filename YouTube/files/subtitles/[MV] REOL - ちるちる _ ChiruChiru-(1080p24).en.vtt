Translation credit to yusukekira, subtitles by PotatoLand

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.620
Besides all such important matters in this world, oh, tell me,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.620
Why is it that we still can’t share the secrets that we both keep?

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.840
The distance between our hearts is too big to be measured

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.140
This whole situation’s just way too absurd

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.960
Chelsea Hotel’s curtains have already started closing

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.900
Like Sid and Nancy, victims of a love that kept on growing

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.340
Just when I thought that I would get your heart in the end,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.740
everything that I knew turned out to be just pretend

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.460
The more I know, the more it is killing me

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.040
Yet, I can’t help but still be curious

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.800
These small quiet prayers, the same old tragic patterns

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.800
But this love I seek seems to be out of reach

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.900
The more I know, the more it is killing me

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.800
Yet, I can’t help but still be curious

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.100
In this mess you put me in

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.860
My words just scatter when I try to tell you just how I feel

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.300
I look away and back at you, but still, nothing has changed now

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.880
My temperature’s too high, this fever keeps on weighing me down

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.820
My throbbing headache from the low air pressure makes me doubt

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.580
This stationary front will ever go away

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.300
Even through a scope lens, I can’t ever look in your eyes

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.760
A brutal, deadly trap like it was set by Bonnie and Clyde

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.840
Adrift radio waves, they keep emitting from my mind

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.840
I guess that it’s fine, guess it’s time that this fades out

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.980
The more I see, the more it’s confusing me

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.940
Yet, I can’t help but keep observing it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.700
These thoughts in my head are spinning round and round

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.800
‘Cause all that pride that you hold is troubling, you know?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.860
The more I see, the more it’s confusing me

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.740
Yet, I can’t help but keep observing it

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.960
Scattering, till these complications have dissolved

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.080
But do I really want them to go?

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.580
This illness plaguing me, there’s no way you could ever cure it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.960
My health is getting worse every day

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.580
A fatal sweetness luring me, then knocking me down

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.940
But I don’t want it any other way, so tell me why

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.920
The more I know, the more it is killing me

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.720
Still, that’s not gonna keep me from learning

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.860
These small quiet prayers, the same old tragic pattern

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.720
But this love I seek seems to be out of reach

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.080
The more I know, the more it is killing me

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.860
Yet, I can’t help but still be curious

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.140
In this mess you put me in

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.760
My words just scatter when I try to tell you just how I feel

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.460
So guess I’ll just pretend that this love isn’t real
