WEBVTT

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.200
We refuse to become a gear

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.540
that spins in a rhythm of monotony

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.800
Conforming to society's expectations

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.250
is like a living hell

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.200
And while we were playing, God brought us into a world ruled by games

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.950
No no no game no life

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.400
In an instant, our lives of peace and tranquility changed

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.350
into a journey up the stairs of glory, carving our names in history

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.850
Before us lies a future of ultimate victory

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.800
With everything proceeding as planned

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.700
Now's our chance, let's cleanse this world together

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.300
We are maverick, assistance is unneeded

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.700
No matter how unfair, or difficult our challenge may be

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.000
Success is only a victory away

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.200
We'll challenge the undefeated using our wits and talent

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.500
And soak in the exhilarating joy of victory

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.900
All we need is faith in ourselves
