00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.800
(yuganda shikai da kiso wa sasoun da)

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.800
my vision distorted, fundamentals invite to

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.890
(subete sarase to)

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.890
expose it all!

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.620
(mazari mono no nai junsui koso ga)

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.620
it's unaltered and therefore pure,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.110
(utsukushiin da to fujouri wa iu)

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.110
that's how absurdity defines beauty.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.020
(soko ni fumikonde tekazu hazuseba)

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.020
if we step into the depths and remove all troubles,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.320
(kuruoshiku nozondeita shunkan ga matteru)

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.320
that insanely desired moment will be waiting for us.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.100
(tagitte shimau wa)

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.100
i'm overflowing!

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.550
(keiraku no kyoukaisen yokotawaru unmei)

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.550
at the boundary of the meridian there is a fate that lies

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.030
(seichou to zetsubou to ga)

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.030
between growth and despair.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.510
(tenohira de odoru you na)

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.510
the souls that dance upon your palm,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.760
(tamashii wo moteasonde kure)

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.760
do with them as you please.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.960
(naraku de kanjiaou)

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.960
let's feel each other in the depths of hell.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.720
(karamiatte)

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.720
entangling, depredating and deceiving.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.720
(ubaiatte)

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.720
(damashiatte)

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.660
(sarashiatte)

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.660
exposing, demanding and going crazy.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.660
(motomeatte)

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.660
(kuruiatte)
