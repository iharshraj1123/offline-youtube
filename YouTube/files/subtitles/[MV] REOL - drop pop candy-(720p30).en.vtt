*Made slight modifications to the lyrics

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.000
Even when it’s raining, I don’t use an umbrella

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.400
The cat meows “It’s a pleasure to meet you”

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.800
My most beloved high heels get soaked

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.900
See now, how the run-of-the-mill everyday life

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.800
Is being dyed in blue as if wanting to change

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.100
That one second when it appears in the puddle

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.800
I just want to see it one time with my own eyes, that’s all

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.800
I am dancing, the whole wide world shaking up goes round and round!

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.900
We will reach it, so let’s pick up the pace!

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.800
I just wanna break away and run to tomorrow

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.900
Since you're stuck in yesterday, if another sunrise never came,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.700
It's okay, it's all okay with me

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.800
I'll just keep moving on, always going forward

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.800
I will love you more and more...

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800
...everyday with you!

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.500
I may fall seven times, but I will keep on moving

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.900
I keep on thinking of you, together with me today

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.900
The girl's tears fall down her cheek

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.800
The cat meows, pretending not to see

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.800
Looking down the sink, the boredom keeps piling up

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.800
All these lies woven from kindness

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.800
Or the truth, tainted with bitterness

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.800
The noise of the raindrops falling into the puddle

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.800
As your fingertips are gently tracing the edge

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800
-Draw it out! -Play it out!

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800
-The sparkling -Wishes

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800
-They will come true! -We will reach them!

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800
So let's raise the pace!

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.900
I want to run so fast that I can make it to space in just one jump

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.900
Even if I cannot go reach the stars and moon high above

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.900
It's okay, it's all okay with me

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.900
I'll just keep moving on, always going forward

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.900
More and more I love...

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.900
...these precious days with you!

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.900
As I cower here, how many times must I cry

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.400
Just to see you today!

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.800
The blue moon shines bright on me

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.800
As I awake from a long, long dream

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.800
Carry me away to tomorrow's future!

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800
Let's pick up the pace!

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.800
I just wanna break away and run to tomorrow

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.900
Since you're stuck in yesterday, if another sunrise never came,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.900
It's okay, It's all okay with me

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.900
I'll just keep moving on, always going forward

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.900
I will love you more and more...

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.900
...everyday with you!

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.800
I may fall seven times, but I will keep on moving

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.900
So that I may have a chance to see you today

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.800
Let's keep loving each other...

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.800
...forever and always!

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800
