00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.520
I am sorry... I am sorry...

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.780
Even those words aren't in my mind...

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.880
Out of my head... Out of my head...

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.120
Get yourself out of there right now!

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.080
You are my privilege and only my privilege,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.040
And I never doubt that...

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.760
Despite low as dirt, she still wants to take the dearest away from me,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.720
Condescend to her crawling on the ground,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.360
That girl only should look up to me,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.600
Because the beauty of my wings are beyond her imagination,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.620
I am not afraid of anything...

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.240
Really nothing can scare me...

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.040
But it hurts...

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.540
It hurts...

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.200
It hurts...

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.120
It really hurts!

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.000
It's only a delusion...

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.000
It's only a delusion...

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.800
It's only a delusion...

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.700
Talking less and less, can't close my eyes at night,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.900
Only wish you can notice, but you still got drunk,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.160
The more we separate, the more I want to be with you,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.920
Even if you can't hear me, I don't want you to hate me...

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.280
Forcefully, pitifully, I was hoping,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.660
The more I think about you, the more ridiculous you are,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.120
Right, it is all that idiot's fault!

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.240
Despite low as dirt, she still wants to take the dearest away from me,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.720
And it's only because I want to appreciate you in my mortal life,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.820
After all the wings of mine won't stand out forever,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.900
I am not afraid of anything...

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.020
Really nothing scares me...

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.620
But it hurts...

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.120
It hurts...

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.700
It hurts...

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.500
It really hurts!

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.400
It's only a delusion...

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.400
It's only a delusion...

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.000
It's only a delusion...

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.160
Painfully, happily, I was hoping,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.520
The more I laugh about you, the more ridiculous you are,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.860
Right, it is all that idiot's fault!

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.880
I am sorry... I am sorry...

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.020
Even those words aren't in my mind...

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.080
Out of my head... Out of my head...

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.500
Get yourself out of there right now!

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.480
You are my privilege and only my privilege,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.800
And I never doubt that...

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.180
Despite low as dirt...

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.940
Despite low as dirt, she still took the dearest away from me,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.100
Look at her crawling on the ground,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.660
So dirty, how could she be cute?

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.920
Look at them, my wings once praised by you,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.100
Aren't they lovely?

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.140
Choosing that girl low as dirt but leaving me aside,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.080
This is definitely your fault,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.480
Something has to be wrong,

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.440
Not even having a chance to say sorry,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.720
I fell through the sky like this,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.720
But I honestly love you,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.620
You who only belongs to me!

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.320
I miss you...

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.900
I miss you...

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.500
I miss you...

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.800
"I really miss you..."

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.600
Everything left for me is saying "I really miss you..."

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.460
You deserve more than this as a traitor!
