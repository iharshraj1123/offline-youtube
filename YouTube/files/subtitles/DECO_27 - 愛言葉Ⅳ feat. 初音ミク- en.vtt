00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.459
A situation I wouldn’t have imagined,

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:27.846
did you feel the same?

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:34.328
It’s heating up inside my head, but I don’t want it to stop

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:37.446
How close are you to a dream come true?

00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:41.147
To a place no one has been too

00:00:41.147 --> 00:00:44.441
“We won’t stop” until we get there.

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:48.552
It will probably be tough, but let’s do it together

00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:49.224
Hey, hey,

00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:50.288
the occasional mayday,

00:00:50.288 --> 00:00:52.107
something that I can’t make alone

00:00:52.107 --> 00:00:53.650
I (Boku), You (Kimi), I (Atashi),

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.788
“like” and “love” all together

00:00:55.788 --> 00:01:01.462
Going somewhere and leaving you all alone is just not possible

00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:03.554
The sound you gave me,

00:01:03.554 --> 00:01:05.348
the bursting HIBANA

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:07.005
From the first meeting,

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:09.223
it was love at first sight

00:01:09.223 --> 00:01:13.107
I can’t imagine a future without you,

00:01:13.107 --> 00:01:15.895
let’s make it the two of us together, now and forever

00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:17.130
Stronger the one person commitment,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.073
the more I want to run away two

00:01:19.073 --> 00:01:20.513
I only have three brain cells,

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.016
thank you four inviting me

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:26.820
I can’t imagine a future without you,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.406
let’s make it the two of us together, yeah, now and forever

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:34.669
Delusions,

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:37.031
the deepening story

00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:38.417
Sentimentality,

00:01:38.417 --> 00:01:40.534
becoming super depressed

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:41.644
Compensation,

00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:43.845
there is no need for clinginess

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:47.391
Federation of never-ending love, how does that sound?

00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:47.891
Hey, hey,

00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:48.966
c’mon mayday,

00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:50.875
what I can do for you

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:52.407
Is never, never, never ending,

00:01:52.407 --> 00:01:54.460
but I want to surprise you so it’s a secret

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.833
How your love always wins,

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:01.298
so unfair!

00:02:14.942 --> 00:02:18.438
I only want you,

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:21.782
Selfishness is free

00:02:21.782 --> 00:02:28.887
It’s stupid to Screeeeaming about the same butterflies

00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:31.652
The sound you gave me,

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:33.138
the bursting HIBANA

00:02:33.138 --> 00:02:35.035
From the first meeting,

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:37.100
it was love at first sight

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.813
I can’t imagine a future without you,

00:02:40.813 --> 00:02:43.693
let’s make it the two of us together, now and forever

00:02:43.693 --> 00:02:45.545
Stronger the one person commitment,

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:47.130
the more I want to run away two

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.050
I only have three brain cells,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.050
thank you four inviting me

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.782
I can’t imagine a future without you,

00:02:54.782 --> 00:02:57.582
let’s make it the two of us together, yeah, now and forever

00:02:57.582 --> 00:03:00.575
Let’s dissect the girl’s heart

00:03:00.575 --> 00:03:04.071
Don’t you think anyone would want to be excited?

00:03:04.071 --> 00:03:05.927
Android Girl,

00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:07.934
is acting up,

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:10.745
the painless kiss won’t leave my mind

00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:12.939
We’re vampires too,

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.295
It’s ok to suck, go ahead

00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:17.100
“I can’t take it anymore”

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.114
is not such a bad boy

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:28.074
I’m singing a song like this to make you shine
