00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.520
If only I hadn’t figured it out.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.180
Laugh at myself while I stumble around.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.860
Just can’t understand loneliness or love.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.700
So I threw away this human form of mine.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.000
But I’ll never throw away the line-filled proof that I’m still alive.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.500
I’m trapped, suffocating on this tiny stage.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.960
By the last act I realize I want to get away.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.580
Every single one of us was performing. Towards the ending credits we’re all running.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.740
Hey, everyone, time to act our hearts out now that there’s nobody watching us.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.400
There’s no such thing as “me” now.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.040
Hard as you look, nowhere to be found.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.600
I can’t remember a single role I was suited for.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.400
Come on, everyone, let’s tear into each other.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.820
It’s overtime, throw in the towel.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.720
Mayday, etiquette out the window.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.580
Our words piss away love and hate.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.920
You’ve been hoping to get something dramatic out of this storyline.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.300
Yes. Yes. You, too, suck in the oxygen.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.840
The baton’s right over there.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.580
Headshot through these noisy thoughts.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.580
Shoot out that beating heart.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.660
Tug on the line you can’t see, and the man behind the curtain appears.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.760
What do those eyes capture?

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.040
We break the moment that we’re touched.
Wrong about everything, we close our mouths.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.620
All of us used to be so innocent.
But then somehow we were typecast as monsters.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.920
If we can’t acknowledge all that’s happened, how will we ever move forward?

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.280
“Let’s be fair, it’s not like you could ever make it.”

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.880
“I really don’t know why you even bother trying.”

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.520
And then I found myself standing in the outfield.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.440
I’d blown past all the nameless riff-raff to get here.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.640
Everybody’s desperately waiting for the hand that will reach out to save them.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.220
I don’t want to think about it.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.940
I’d much rather play the idiot.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.560
I can’t remember a single role I was suited for.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.340
And here I am. I’m on the front lines.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.800
The flag dancing, raised up high.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.520
Against the wall with fellow soldiers.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.440
We don’t needs words to understand each other.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.760
A story should be filled with all kinds of dramatic twists and turns.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.180
Yes. Yes. You, too, suck in the oxygen.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.580
Let’s make our vows anew.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.500
I’ve only got one chance this time.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.380
I’ll bet it all on this moment.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.840
The climax is nearly here.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.600
My sweaty hand tight like a vice grip.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.260
Alone I cry aloud.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.520
The truth’s hid away and it can’t be found.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.540
Those ridiculed don’t have a place to call home.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.880
I try to remember, but no emotions come out.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.080
Why am I crying when I don’t have a reason to?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.340
I can’t feel the warmth of the weather or mankind.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.440
I can’t help but steer clear of their helping hands.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.780
Love keeps on oozing out of the open hole inside my chest.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.920
An eye peers in at me as I feel I’m about to die.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.180
You appear before those who’ve given up.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.380
Always with that sneering face of yours.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.200
I wonder how I must look to someone like you.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.180
I take a deep breath. Now I'm ready.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.180
Come on.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.660
I can’t remember a single role I was suited for.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.380
Come on, everyone, let’s tear into each other.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.840
It’s overtime, throw in the towel.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.560
Mayday, etiquette out the window.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.460
Our words piss away love and hate.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.840
You’ve been hoping to get something dramatic out of this storyline.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.160
Yes. Yes. You, too, suck in the oxygen.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.720
The baton’s right over there.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.540
Headshot through these noisy thoughts.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.360
Shoot out that beating heart.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.900
Pulling the invisible strings, the man behind the curtain appears.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.060
“What do those eyes capture?”
