00:00:00.614 --> 00:00:03.125
There's too much noise

00:00:03.125 --> 00:00:04.875
Close the window

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.291
Let me sleep yet

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:13.415
Murmurs remain dropped by the pillow

00:00:13.415 --> 00:00:15.249
Get out of my way

00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:20.581
Increased the pace of tossing and turning

00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:24.789
I don't wake up with my arms numb

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.913
I can stay in the dream forever

00:00:28.913 --> 00:00:33.080
Hey, come on, wake me up

00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:34.871
I'm bored 

00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:36.912
Not without you

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:39.954
The days pass by tastelessly 

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:41.995
I just remembered 

00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:44.120
The sigh of that day

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.994
I pretended not to see it

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:50.577
because I was scared

00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:09.866
You've been making too much noise

00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.741
Close the window

00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:15.199
Let me sleep yet

00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:20.282
Your words still fall on my pillow

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:22.032
Get out of my way

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:27.448
I drank all the juice in my sleepy eyes 

00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:31.614
I don't need you to be mad at me

00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:35.780
I can swim in my dreams forever

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.029
Hey, come on, wake me up 

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:41.696
I'm bored

00:01:41.696 --> 00:01:43.696
Not without you

00:01:43.696 --> 00:01:46.778
The days pass by tastelessly 

00:01:46.778 --> 00:01:48.778
I just remembered 

00:01:48.778 --> 00:01:50.903
It was overflowing that day

00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:53.653
Your soft tears 

00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:55.527
It makes my heart ache

00:02:12.108 --> 00:02:14.525
You've been making too much noise

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:16.400
Close the window

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.483
Let me sleep yet

00:02:19.844 --> 00:02:24.898
There's a hint of something left in the two pillows

00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:27.773
Get out of my way

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.773
I'm bored

00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:31.648
Not without you 

00:02:31.648 --> 00:02:34.814
The days pass by tastelessly 

00:02:34.814 --> 00:02:36.814
I just remembered

00:02:36.814 --> 00:02:38.814
The sigh of that day 

00:02:38.814 --> 00:02:44.729
I just wish I could face it.

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.396
I'm bored

00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:48.354
Not without you

00:02:48.354 --> 00:02:51.437
The days pass by tastelessly 

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.437
I just remembered 

00:02:53.437 --> 00:02:55.561
It was overflowing that day

00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:58.352
Your soft tears 

00:02:58.352 --> 00:03:01.644
forced smile 

00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:03.852
remain in one's head 

00:03:03.852 --> 00:03:06.643
Your voice is soothing,

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:08.643
 it makes me want to sleep again
