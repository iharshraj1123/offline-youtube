00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.220
Fire! Take aim! Fire! Go!

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.280
Attention! Take cover! Advance! Stop!

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.380
Fire! Take aim! Fire! Go!

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.300
Attention! Take cover! Advance! Stop!

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.520
To the battlefield! The front lines! Then the edge of death!

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.700
Show your commitment born from casting your life away!

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.980
Fire! Take aim! Fire! Go!

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.100
Attention! Take cover! Advance! Stop!

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.440
I'm sure you can hear the sounds of their gun

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.220
The voices of maggots trying to resist.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.160
Stomp them out! Stomp them out!

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.380
Men, what is our mission?

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.120
Extermination! Not a single creature spared!

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.100
There's only one thing to do:

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.500
Create a living Hell!

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.100
Why do we advance deeper into the flames?charge head on into a rain of bullets?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.180
What a ridiculous question! It’s for the sake of the empire!

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.740
To the battlefield! The front lines! Then the edge of death!

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.080
Show your commitment born from casting your life away!

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.560
Offer your loyalty! Your obedience!  Then your very soul!

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.020
offer every fiber of your being, raising a triumphant shout!

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.300
Go forth! Prove that we can build

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.720
A pile of corpses that can reach the heavens!

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.320
Ahh . . . Ahh . . . Ahhh !!!

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.180
Fire! Take aim! Fire! Go!

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.320
Attention! Take cover! Advance! Stop!

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.280
Fire! Take aim! Fire! Go!

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.440
Attention! Take cover! Advance! Stop!

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.980
Where’s your fear now?

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.960
Look at all the blood and flesh: it’s like firework!

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.320
It splatters and splatters

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.920
I haven’t forgotten my thousands of scars

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.960
The flame’s heat… spilling organs…

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.880
Final cries…clouded eyes…

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.160
Ahh, those are the things I truly seek!

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.540
Peace and tranquility, let alone reconciliation,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.160
Are the acts of domestic dogs who’re forsaken their fangs!

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.560
Sheer madness, brought on by despair and disturbance,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.060
Sounds more like Paradise that it dose Hell!

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.000
Those four limbs are made for dancing.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.060
They’re made for dancing madly!

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.520
Humans are worthless!

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.940
Everyone fighting here is worthless,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.520
So show them that your fruitless lives can still bloom!

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:40.120
Law and order…are constructed by madmen.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:51.440
Completely false. Utterly absurd from the beginning to the end!

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.560
To the battlefield! The front lines! Then the edge of death!

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.080
Show your commitment born from casting your life away!

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.840
Offer your loyalty! Your obedience!  Then your very soul!

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.140
offer every fiber of your being, raising a triumphant shout!

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.080
Go forth! Prove that we can build

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.320
A pile of corpses that can reach the heavens!

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.080
And an explosive sound

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.060
That can even drown out their lingering hatred!

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.160
Fire! Take aim! Fire! Go!

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.220
Attention! Take cover! Advance! Stop!

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.140
Fire! Take aim! Fire! Go!

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.340
Attention! Take cover! Advance! Stop!
