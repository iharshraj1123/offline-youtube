00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.300
Sensei

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.660
Am I also a Vocaloid, too?

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.600
TETOTETOTETOTETO

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.800
Please don't boo me, I know I'm not a pro.

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.220
My favorite food is a baguette, which goes best with margarine.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.040
My Chimera age is 31.

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.540
But my real age is 15!

8
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.800
While aiming to be at the top, I will sing as an Utauloid!

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.200
TetoTetoTetoTeto

10
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.620
"Don't call me 30's Ma'am!"

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.400
TetoTetoTetoTeto

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.800
Okaaay!

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.340
I'm a diva! I ain't no fake!

13
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.160
I want to sing so many songs!

14
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.120
Like a Voca-kind-of monopoly?

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.840
I'm a idol, I ain't a fake!

16
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.720
Don't tell me, my hair looks like drills!

17
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.820
If you do..

18
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.320
SCREEEEEWW!

19
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.360
This is my Kasane Territory!

20
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.940
As you can see with Teto, she has two forms.

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.580
Call her hair on her head drills, and her second form will activate.

22
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.040
Finding a rental DVD that's been missing for a month!

23
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.440
Running off to the nearest store to return it,

24
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.320
Got told off, and became very blue!

25
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.200
The most perfect idol,

26
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.940
Totally not a drill.

27
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.720
I can sing without some ten thousand yen,

28
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.920
Afterall, I am an Utauloid!

29
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.500
I'm a diva, I ain't a fake!

30
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.420
I'm an idol, I ain't a fake!

31
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.800
I want to sing, so many songs!

32
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.580
Like a Voca-Kind-of-Monopoly?

33
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.480
I'm a idol, I swear I'm not fake!

34
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.360
Please don't call my hair a drill..

35
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.860
If you do...

36
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.360
Why do you even care?!

37
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.920
This is my Kasane Territory!

38
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.280
What do you think of this new star?

39
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.500
Hm, she's very promising, don't you think?

40
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.500
Miss, aren't you aware? That's Kasane Teto, she's around 30 years old!

41
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.780
SCREEEEEEEWWW!

42
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.960
I'm a diva, I ain't no fake!

43
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.400
I'm an idol, I ain't a fake!

44
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.800
I want to sing so many songs!

45
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.960
Like a Voca-kind-of-Monopoly?

46
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.760
I'm an idol, I ain't a fake!

47
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.280
Please don't call my hair "drills"..

48
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.400
If you do...

49
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.040
SCREEEEEEEEWWW!

50
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.860
This is my Kasane Territory!

51
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.600
At first, I know I was a nothing..

52
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.040
But now, I really want to sing a lot!

53
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.960
I'll keep reaching for the top,

54
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.400
and someday, I'll be a Vocaloid too!

55
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.520
I'm a diva, I ain't a fake!

56
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.040
I want to sing so many beautiful songs!

57
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.280
One day, I'll be able to reach all your hearts!

58
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.500
This is my Kasane Territory!

59
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.640
This is my Kasane Territory!

60
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.440
Each of you are all kind of dumb..

61
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.860
^-^
