00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.570
Grow up!Nah mean?

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.000
track Giga

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.540
Inferiority, superiority, BRING IT ON!

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.600
The greatest island, sleepless Japan.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.380
Mathematica is so childish.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.840
Even if I get busted,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.080
I have no pride.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.360
This pretense of elegance is setting off alarms,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.540
simply observing is no fun. (It's boring)

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.740
Hey, bring on a more

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.260
superior mistake

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.300
and deal with your boredom.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.900
Mommy, I don’t want it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.480
Mommy, I don’t want it to end here

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.640
Mommy, I don’t want it to end here, after all.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.940
It’s so tepid, it’s making me go crazy.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.880
Goodbye to this child’s play drama.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.600
You know,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.040
I can’t stay like this forever.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.000
Dun-dun-dun,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.940
I’m going to become an adult

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.540
and taste the bitterness

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.160
and sweetness

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.040
of the world, now.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.140
Pan-pan-pan,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.500
times have changed.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.400
It’s not just filled

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.180
with bad things

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.500
It’s not just filled with bad things, right?

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.020
Your past, sins,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.580
punishments, everything

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.820
with those bare hands, with love,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.340
survive and fix them!

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.280
We’re stirring things up

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.000
Don’t pay attention to that green girl all the time.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.820
Now

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.960
When you do, you’ll pass.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.040
It’s marked with a red pen.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.400
Did I make a mistake somewhere?

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.880
Conformity when dealing

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.260
with alcohol, women, money, and XXXX (drugs).

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.080
Chill

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.280
It was a joke,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.040
black comedy!

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.800
Situations that make me lift my middle finger

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.140
It happens too frequently there aren’t enough fingers, so

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.860
loser?

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.360
Bring it on

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.860
from the start!

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.460
I don’t need to hear “calm down.”

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.820
Before I die,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.820
Before I die what I want is

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.100
to grow taller and blow a kiss

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.960
to my hometown.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.760
The highlight of the show is from here on out,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.060
so get ready!

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.080
Dan-dan-dan

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.900
we’ll become adults

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.440
and with our eye on the counter,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.100
we’ll shoot our worst days

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.600
with vigilant hostility.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.360
No one can see the future,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.480
so it’s still a draw, right?

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.180
Bugs, losses,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.640
slip-ups, everything.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.040
With your bare hands, struggle!

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.380
Live through and overturn your situation.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.160
Dan-dan-dan

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.860
I can’t surrender

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.540
to merely worthless things.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.680
Get it? That’s my aesthetic.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.760
This foolishly honest fist

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.780
is my one

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.120
(wholehearted)

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.520
trump card

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.980
(simple honesty)

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.300
Shouting this inferiority,

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.980
“I’m out!”

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.260
“Farewell!”

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.880
BRING IT ON

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.900
We’re not gonna quit!

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.300
Dun-dun-dun

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.700
I’m going to become an adult

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.800
and taste the bitterness

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.500
and sweetness

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.900
of the world, now.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.320
A bright future where we cross paths again.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.220
You understand

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.740
I’m not a child any longer, right?

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.320
Epochs and opportunities won’t wait around for me.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.900
With your bare hands, at the risk of your life, 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.800
survive and bring it on!

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.060
It’s the era of love.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.280
Well then, everyone. We’ll leave first.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.680
