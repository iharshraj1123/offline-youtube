00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.200
Put on a mask and don a false identity

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.200
I'm broken down into my core

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.900
Blood dripping, head is splitting,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.200
Words are falling free

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.800
I can't take it anymore

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.600
One by one it's over, this silence can't get louder

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.100
Bolt my jaw shut and throw away, away, away the key

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.100
Just one second longer

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.000
A speed run to game over

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.600
I am a fatality...

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.600
I'm holding onto, onto, onto nothing

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.300
I've begun crashing, crashing, crashing hard

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.700
Let me feel panic, panic, panic again

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.100
Set ablaze, I'll shine brighter than the stars

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.000
and I'll finally see ten-thousand others just like me

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.700
Filling up the night sky, we'll never be lonely

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.300
Take me up where I can feel the zero gravity

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.200
Come on, Come and be free

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.700
Come on, Come and see...

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.800
I'll cross my heart and swear I'll never be like that

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.200
With the tears seeping through the laughs

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.000
Blood dripping, guts are spilling

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.500
old fears come for me

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.700
How long can I last?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.000
One by one it's over, this screaming can't get louder

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.200
Bolt my jaw shut and throw away, away, away the key

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.700
Just one second longer, A speed run to game over

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.500
I'm praying for serenity...

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
I'm holding onto, onto, onto nothing

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.150
I've begun crashing, crashing, crashing hard

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.750
Let me feel panic, panic, panic again

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.050
Set ablaze, I'll shine brighter than the stars

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.000
and I'll finally see ten-thousand others just like me

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.650
Filling up the night sky, we'll never be lonely

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.050
Take me up where I can feel the zero gravity

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.200
Come on, Come and be free

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.700
Come on, Come and see...

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.240
I'm holding onto, onto, onto nothing

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.010
I've begun crashing, crashing, crashing hard

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.310
Let me feel panic, panic, panic again

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.210
Set ablaze, I'll shine brighter than...

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.910
The Stars

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.710
and I'll finally see ten-thousand others just like me

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.610
Filling up the night sky, we'll never be lonely

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.010
Take me up where I can feel the zero gravity

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.910
Come on, Come and be free

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.910
Come on, Come and see

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.410
Make it a secret, Think you can keep it?

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.410
I'm not okay and I'll never be the same

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.810
Let's make a surprise, Set a date and time

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.010
Don't let them know

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.010
I won't say goodbye before I go..
