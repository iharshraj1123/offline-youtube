00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.100
"Mabel"

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.000
Cover by: Eve

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Translation by: Eumi

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.800
That's not funny

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.020
Saying "I've become unlucky"

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.780
Look who's talking

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.700
How many times have you fooled me already?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.160
Playing with that finger

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.760
Don't mess with me

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.780
Even though you know nothing will change if you pretend to be the victim

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.760
Just like this it becomes night again

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.220
Good night

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.900
That's why

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.980
We only face each other after the day breaks

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.020
See, we will be sleeping today

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.900
And since,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.960
There is no meaning to these words

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.740
So don't worry about it and close your eyes

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.740
People say that it's just something that changed after getting hurt, right?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.640
How many times has this happened already?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.240
It's just sleeping in that chest

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.160
Accidentally saying "I don't hate you"

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.760
Even though those words were shaking

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.760
Why do we cover our eyes so easily like that?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.240
Why? Why? Why?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.960
We use vague words because we are scared of lies

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.920
See you later,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.200
The light shakes from far away

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.020
Here,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.940
It's already too late to ask about our love

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.820
So just pretend you didn't hear anything

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.720
Ahhh

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.060
Become blue, as if you've become ripe

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.640
Ahhh

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.200
Become red, as if you're rotting away

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.760
Ahhh

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.360
It can't be

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.700
It can't be helped

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.180
That only the awkward thoughts remain

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.280
That's why

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.060
That's why

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.960
We only face each other after the day breaks

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.140
See, we will be sleeping today

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.040
And since,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.020
Those kind of words are called kindness

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.240
A feeling that's so empty I can almost touch it,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.140
Remains
