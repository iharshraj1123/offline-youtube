00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.442
The moon that floated in the night like a jelly fish

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:08.010
Has split open

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.380
When I glance at someone’s back at the bus stop

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.020
You, as you were that summer, are in my head

00:00:21.658 --> 00:00:22.710
Only

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.350
"Just a Sunny Day for You"

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.550
Torii gates, dried-out clouds;

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.450
the scent of summer strokes my cheek

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.930
Until I become an adult,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.760
look,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.925
I’ll keep standing on tiptoe to make myself taller

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.150
Tired out from playing,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.110
behind the bus stop I could even see the sky

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.460
Even if the summer comes to an end soon

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.310
I’ll definitely, definitely remember

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.810
Becoming an adult without being able to catch up

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.850
Night blooms in your pocket

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.650
If I can’t put it into words I’ll be alone

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.517
But that’s all right,

00:01:08.517 --> 00:01:11.320
I’ve already resigned myself to it

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.180
Only

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.910
A summer day, dried-out clouds,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.710
Nanking cherry trees, a rusted stoplight

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.980
In my memories, it always smells like summer

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.620
Photographs are just scraps of paper

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.410
And memories are nothing but garbage

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.650
Because I didn’t understand that, I kept my mouth shut

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.410
In my memory, you rest forever
on the single stone in a summer field*

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.890
Becoming an adult while looking down

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.920
I can’t catch up, it’s just a sunny day for you

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.760
Unable to put things into words, we climbed the hill

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.690
In our shadows,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.080
night is blooming

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.978
This line references a haiku by Masaoka Shiki, “絶えず人 いこふ夏野の 石一つ,” which roughly translates to “people are always resting on the single stone in the summer field.”

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.122
We’ve become adults

00:02:34.122 --> 00:02:35.790
while looking down

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.030
Clap your hands how you like

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.610
Climbing the road up the hill at sunset

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.550
Our shadows…

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.460
Becoming an adult without being able to catch up

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.480
Night blooms in your pocket

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.310
Even if we can’t put it into words, we are one**

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.150
That’s enough, I think

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.910
I’m only chewing over memories

00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:10.906
of you

00:03:13.157 --> 00:03:17.152
