00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.260
Can’t we put an end today

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.040
To spitting out indifferent words

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.200
And crying over those memories?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.900
Waiting for the “1, 2…” signal

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.880
Holding hands with you is

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.760
An act of courage for me

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.320
Phase &lt;1&gt;

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.640
‘Cause we shouldn’t stand still, right?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.000
Life is a sham

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.360
Don't say you can't do it

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.740
Don’t say it

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.240
Don’t say it’s too late now

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.600
Come, come

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.940
Now we form a circle and start to spin

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.340
Bit by bit I come to hate it, but I come to like it

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.760
Hey, hey, I don’t even understand the meeting of my selves(*)

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.500
We steadily close the gap

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.920
But we remain far apart

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.440
Da-dum, carried by the music we start to dance

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.780
Wretchedly, I come to hate it, but I come to like it

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.620
Hey, hey, I don’t understand now or ever

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.560
Shake shake my heart

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.180
Yay

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.000
There’s no such thing as a right answer

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.840
So, where the hell do I have to go

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.060
To find the end of this story?

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.700
Waiting for the “1, 2…” signal

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.640
Touching your hand is

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.460
An act of courage for me

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.200
Phase &lt;2&gt;

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.320
There’s no meaning to being humble and respectful

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.700
So bye-bye to my embarrassing dreams

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.040
From now on, forever, let’s get along

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.780
Let’s get along.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.080
Come, come

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.340
We now avert our eyes from each other

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.680
Bit by bit I come to hate it, but I come to like it

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.140
Hey, hey, I don’t even understand the meeting of my selves

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.020
I steadily become better

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.520
But I’m crumbling to pieces

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.800
Da-dum, you disappear before I can touch you

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.120
Wretchedly, I come to hate it, but I come to like it

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.980
Hey, hey, I don’t understand now or ever

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.320
Until we can understand each other, we-

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.440
- Shouldn’t say it’s too late

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.800
Come, come

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.080
Now we form a circle and start to spin

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.360
Bit by bit I come to hate it, but I come to like it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.960
Hey, hey, I don’t even understand the meeting of my selves

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.680
We steadily close the gap

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.100
But we remain far apart

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.560
Da-dum, carried by the music we start to dance

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.800
Wretchedly, I come to hate it, but I come to like it

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.660
Hey, hey, I don’t understand now or ever

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.660
Shake shake my heart

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.440
Yay

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.400
(*) “Jibun Kaigi” is a 1972 manga one-shot by Fujiko F. Fujio (best known as the creator of Doraemon).

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.400
The story is about a young man leading a lonely and impoverished life

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.400
who finds himself dragged by future versions of himself

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.400
into the titular “meeting of the selves.”

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.400
His various selves cannot get along, however, and the meeting ends in tragedy.
