00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:05.166
We can choose the way of our future

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.000
Try a brand new path

00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:12.375
If I change the world…

00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:17.375
If I change the world…

00:00:44.708 --> 00:00:47.500
Say goodbye to everyone
Who stands against us

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:51.208
No one has the power to stop a change
That comes through music

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.083
No, you can't stop magic

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:58.416
Close your eyes
And you can see the future before you

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:02.125
Every note I sing is bringin' you closer
To your purpose

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:05.416
Once your there don't let go

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.333
You wanna play a real game,
Unfurl the chain

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:12.500
Melody strung out like
We're walkin' on a tight rope

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:15.000
Don't wanna cry, don't wanna try,
Wanna forget

00:01:15.083 --> 00:01:17.083
Just let me live inside a dreamland

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:19.333
Wanna be free!

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:22.166
And let a brand new era dawn

00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:24.875
I know that we can

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.458
Create a New World!

00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:31.125
We can choose the way of our future

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.833
Try a brand new path

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.875
If I change the world…

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:39.208
If I change the world…

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.416
This boundless music
Brings transformation

00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:44.083

Reach even further

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.166
This dream will come true

00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:50.875
I believe in you

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:15.166
Say goodbye to everything
That's weighing you down

00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:19.083
Transcend beyond reality
To colorful worlds of music

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.750
We need to keep on rising

00:02:23.583 --> 00:02:26.250
Close your eyes and take my hand
We're runnin' together

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:29.833
We don't have to live like this,
I know we can all do better

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:32.958
I sing for liberation

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:37.208
You wanna play a real game,
Unfurl the chain

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:40.166
Melody lighting up the path
To new horizons

00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:42.750
Don't wanna cry, don't wanna try,
Wanna forget

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:44.833
Just let me live inside a dreamland

00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.083
Wanna be free!

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.833
And let a brand new era dawn

00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.625
I know that we can

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.208
Create a New World!

00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:59.000
We can choose the way of our future

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:01.000
Try a brand new path

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:03.250
If I change the world…

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:06.708
If I change the world…

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.166
This boundless music
Brings transformation

A New Genesis
