00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.633
I'm sick and tired of being alone

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.466
Wanna be connected

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:13.800
Have a bond to hold on to
Just gonna lay it all out, how I feel

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:16.400
Listen baby makin' you happy
Whether you like it or not

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.433
Gonna be up in your ears
No run-in' away just wait for the beat to drop

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.400
Listen for a surprise
Every word will entice

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.966
Reality is overrated

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.500
You're not gonna outthink me
I thought of everything

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.466
You'll never get it, you can't keep up

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.833
So just stay out of my way

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.900
Be my good good good boys and girls

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.366
You think you're so tough?
Well, I had enough of it

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.300
I got something here that's better

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.933
Come on up and we can sing together
Fun unfettered

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:48.333
Get on stage, let's go

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.533
Wanna make your day
Do my thing loud and proud

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:54.466
No shame in what I create
I got this down

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:59.233
Everything exactly how we want it
This is a utopia

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.700
Been a long time comin', now it's here to stay
You can't deny

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.966
It's a miracle of mercy
You can't stop it if you try

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:11.133
I know it's possible
I'm not tryin' to ask too much

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:13.600
I wanna know how to give what you want
Explicate all you got deep inside

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.333
Don't need nothin' in return
Stay with me or I will Frrrreak out!

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:18.900
Wouldn't you rather be floatin' up high
To your cares sayin' “bye?”

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.300
Fanservice flowin' so free you could die

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.066
Just you and I, no ending in sight

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.466
It'll be super fun! Hee hee hee ha oh!

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:27.100
Don't you now I'm gonna make you a zealot
In here all logic has got to go

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.800
Please don't go!

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.800
Nobody here gets to leave, oh no!
No, no, no

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.233
I got the mic, and I'll never say good bye

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:36.166
Just follow the beat
Let the melody inspire

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:38.166
Luring you into enchantmen

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:41.833
Come on up and we can sing together
Fun unfettered

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:45.100
Get on stage, let's go

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.566
Wanna make your day
Do my thing loud and proud

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.800
No shame in what I create
I got this down

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.366
Everything exactly how we want it
This is a utopia

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.033
Been a long time comin', now it's here to stay
You can't deny

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.600
It's a miracle of mercy
You can't stop it if you try

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.166
I know it's possible
I'm not tryin' to ask too much

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:10.933
Salvation's got to come
This generation's done

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:13.066
It's tired of never being listened to

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:18.166
The screams were never heard
The suffering endured but no more!

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.766
Watch me rock this
They got nothin'

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:23.566
Up to me,
You just need to stay out of my way

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:26.000
There's no turnin' back now

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.600
Gonna be singin' jointly for all time

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.700
Blowin' your mind with my pace
Drummin' to burst your ear drum

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.933
Bring in the bass, guitar and keys
Macaferri got nothin'

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:37.066
On me, no
Ooo-wah! Oh let me hear you shout!

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.066
Banish every gaslight
Let clarity shine

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:45.566
Gotta clean up this brainwash
Don't let ‘em tell you lies, heads up,

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:47.766
Let my song clear your senses

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.533
All you really need
Is my true voice
