00:00:21.403 --> 00:00:26.343
Ah, truly, what a wonderful world

00:00:26.343 --> 00:00:31.247
And so, once again today, my own unsightliness confuses me

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:38.802
And yet, this feeling of wanting to be loved by another

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:42.000
Is what makes me suffer

00:00:43.312 --> 00:00:48.899
Ugly, honestly, my face is as if

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.659
God drew it with his left hand

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.334
Inevitably, all the love songs this world has to offer

00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:04.030
Certainly not a single one is written for me

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:14.400
Kisses I can’t use, pity cast upon me

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.439
Protecting my body is scar of spangles

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.598
Enough to make me unlovable

00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:26.771
Dazzlingly

00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:31.498
I shine and swallow the dark of the night

00:01:31.498 --> 00:01:34.350
Rap Tap Tap Tap

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.166
Now, watch this love

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:41.913
1mg of fireworks sting my eyes

00:01:41.913 --> 00:01:44.467
Drag on Drag on

00:01:44.628 --> 00:01:48.000
How funny, this world is bizarre

00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:56.150
Gira Gira Gira Gira

00:02:06.107 --> 00:02:11.433
Even to the Buddha in his enlightenment I remain unknown

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:16.104
It seems like I’ve surely gone insane

00:02:16.104 --> 00:02:22.238
Is it the world at fault or is it me?

00:02:22.238 --> 00:02:27.023
Co-existing was impossible from the start

00:02:27.295 --> 00:02:36.000
How sad would I be if I were just an imitation, so I just ran with all I had

00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:41.426
Before the heavy acid rain washes it away

00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:46.533
I hold my fluorescent scar dearly

00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:49.597
Blazing,

00:02:49.597 --> 00:02:53.899
I am a wolf of the night spewing fire

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.934
Rap Tap Tap Tap

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.300
Stay there and watch this dance

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:04.293
Be strong with your own unique makeup (weapon)

00:03:04.293 --> 00:03:06.763
Flap up Flap up

00:03:06.763 --> 00:03:08.763
Suddenly, anxiety strikes

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.646
Loneliness is my gasoline, As I run through this abject town

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:19.706
Close your eyes. Are you ready? Are you ready?

00:03:19.706 --> 00:03:27.684
If God was left handed, I can’t imagine how happy I would be

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.500
Dazzlingly

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.876
I shine and swallow the dark of the night,

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:46.629
Rap Tap Tap Tap

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.013
Now, watch this love

00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:54.266
1mg of fireworks sting my eyes

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:56.687
Drag on Drag on

00:03:56.687 --> 00:04:00.000
How funny, this world is bizarre

00:04:00.322 --> 00:04:09.556
Gira Gira Gira Gira

00:04:09.556 --> 00:04:14.464
Give love, the flowers will bloom (Gira gira)

00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:19.555
I can’t stay the way I am, no one can

00:04:19.555 --> 00:04:21.592
What a wonderful world!

00:04:21.592 --> 00:04:24.607
I will shine on
