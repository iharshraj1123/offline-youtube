00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:09.300
The destination of the running vector

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.600
What answer will you write in the blank?

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.700
Q: The relationship of the analysis

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.600
Inferred from the next line

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.800
A: Just like in the textbook

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.800
even this place is lacking in realism.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.600
Ah... I've already left those complicated theories behind

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.600
I want to cram more into my youth with you.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.000
Why is there a throbbing in my left chest pocket?

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.500
Regardless of the research paper

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.500
There are still basically no right answers.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.500
Shout for the future with the highest failing grade

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
My heart is still growing

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.900
It's alright to hope for a little more from here, isn't it?

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.500
I'm going to be ambitious, its definitely the fast approach

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.000
Mr. Teacher, give me my grade!
