00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.680
Oh compared child, compared child

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.160
I already know

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.060
You don't have to tell me,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.500
I know I'll never be as good as her

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.620
So please don't compare, no don't compare

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.480
Just leave me alone

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.700
My left side hurts and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.500
it troubles me.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.320
I always felt the gap between us

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.580
I was alive but I was aiming too high

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.960
A B C D E F G

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.820
No matter what I chose

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.100
I failed much more than I succeeded

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.140
and I only got hurt some more

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.900
Pain, O pain, go flying away

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.000
or so I keep wishing even though I know it’s pointless

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And before I know it, I start to cry

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How easy would it be if all this was put to an end

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.400
Just throw me away

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.220
Compared child, compared child

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.780
I know that already

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.860
It's just fate that people mock what I love the most

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.920
That’s how I gave up, yes I gave up already

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.080
Just leave me alone

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.300
But I keep dreaming about something, Ridiculous, isn't it?

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.840
It was only for a bit, just a short while

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.220
but I was facing it as my real true self

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.640
V W &amp; X Y Z

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420
No matter which side I'm on

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.700
it seems that my failures keep standing out

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.700
I think it just got worse

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.720
So dark, so dark, I got so scared

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.760
and before I knew it my body would not budge

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.660
I can't even see what I love

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.620
The girl right next to me had raised a flag

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.260
It’s too bright

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.940
Compared child, compared child

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.420
I'm alive in spite of it all

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.480
I can’t bring home any good results, but I am still alive

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.600
So I let go of my breath and closed my mouth

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.660
Just leave me alone

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.940
Then I will close my eyes, Finally it's the end

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.300
From parallel lines we cross our paths

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.500
Hey, let's put it all aside for now

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.000
I can't!

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.500
Oh compared child, compared child

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.020
I know it already

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.100
I know that my efforts won't go rewarded, even 'til the end

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.160
So don’t mind me and don’t talk to me

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.200
Just leave me alone

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.400
If only I knew right from the start

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.840
that I'd come to hate you

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.300
Compared child, compared child

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.820
I know she's talking to me

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.860
She's making assumptions because she can't see anything

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.860
so remember this and don't you forget it anymore

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.000
I actually love you so much

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.420
You stopped breathing

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.560
as I embraced you

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:31.560
The two of them linking hands.
