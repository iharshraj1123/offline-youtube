00:00:01.037 --> 00:00:01.584
Oh

00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:04.143
I'm born, what should I do with my life?

00:00:04.143 --> 00:00:08.000
I have unlimited possibilities, it’s only been 8 seconds

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.650
I wonder if I can do anything, I wonder if I can be anything

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.016
Turning away from the misfortune to come

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:19.248
Should I live earnestly, or should I live slyly?

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.421
I want to help you, I want to defeat you, both sides of me are true

00:00:22.753 --> 00:00:26.252
Can I just get my dream and love at a drive-thru? Trying hard is tiresome, right?

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:30.204
I'll just read the synopsis of books and movies

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.008
2:30 Life Remaining

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:38.279
2:30 Life Remaining

00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:42.899
Repeating “thank you”, “good-bye” and “see you again”

00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:45.626
Already 45 seconds, it’s spring

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:49.270
2:30 Life Remaining

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.825
My disposable youth

00:00:53.128 --> 00:00:57.292
My replaceable life that’s less than three minutes

00:00:57.693 --> 00:01:00.949
Please don’t consume it with tears

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:11.586
Is this what dreams are like? Is this what love is like?

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:13.166
Life is like

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.313
A common song

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:18.762
More than a minute has passed, and I've come to know my limits

00:01:19.172 --> 00:01:21.885
But it's still too early to understand everything

00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:26.000
Tick-tock, tick-tock, thinking of you who's already gone

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.373
I know it's not quite the dream I imagined a minute ago

00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:34.000
2:30 Life Remaining

00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:37.309
2:30 Life Remaining

00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:42.000
Repeating "thank goodness", "everything’s over" and "oh well"

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:44.706
Already 1 minute and 45 seconds, it’s autumn

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.338
2:30 Life Remaining

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:51.872
Another magic disappears

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:56.333
For you? For me? Life that’s lamented exaggeratedly

00:01:56.753 --> 00:01:59.932
Please don't beautify it too much

00:02:00.413 --> 00:02:03.651
Like the books and movies I skipped through that day

00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:06.332
My life has become a short song

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:10.716
Even if I have to say goodbye in 2:30

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.781
I want you to let me say that I was happy

00:02:14.262 --> 00:02:17.107
2:30 Life Remaining

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:20.699
2:30 Life Remaining

00:02:20.982 --> 00:02:25.057
My life that’s less than three minutes, about to end

00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:27.803
Please don't think of it as someone else's problem

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.647
Oh
