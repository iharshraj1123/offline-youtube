00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.560
“Why does the scent of the rain make me feel nostalgic?

00:00:06.712 --> 00:00:12.183
Why does my heart clamor as summer approaches?

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.854
Why do I cry when people laugh at me?

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.323
Is it all right to think that even so I’ll be rewarded someday?”

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.145
With the word “goodbye”

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.967
tearing so much at my chest,

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:34.349
I was standing still for just a few moments

00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:37.250
at sunset

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.950
“Teacher, I want to talk about my life.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.817
What should I do from now on?

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.520
Are you just going to tell me
‘no one knows that’ or something?

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.583
Look,

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:51.250
it’s not that I want to suffer.

00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:54.080
I just want to live without doing anything.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.756
Is it selfish to just want to look at the blue sky?”

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.000
“Why do I lie even though it makes my heart ache?

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.727
Why do only bad people prosper?

00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:28.330
Why is it that the character for ‘happiness’(幸)
includes the ‘money’(￥)sign?

00:01:28.516 --> 00:01:33.940
Is it on purpose that leaving out a single stroke
turns it into the character for ‘pain’(辛)?”

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.734
With a price sticker saying “youth”

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:39.550
stuck to my back

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.705
I was hoping in some way for

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:47.810
Hitchcock-like suspense

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.683
“Teacher, I don’t care.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.469
Just going on living causes me pain.

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:58.120
Neither Nietzche nor Freud wrote about how to fill this hole.

00:01:58.123 --> 00:01:59.060
I just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.876
want to close my eyes in the scent of summer,

00:02:01.883 --> 00:02:04.683
And sketch out the height of the clouds with my fingers.

00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:09.200
Is it selfish to just want to relive memories?”

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:24.617
“A story where people die dramatically will sell, won’t it?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.383
I’ve come to hate that even the moment
that a flower’s petals fall has a price on it.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.698
What was your dream, Teacher?

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.072
Did you forget it when you became an adult?”

00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:44.180
"Teacher, I want to talk about my life.

00:02:44.183 --> 00:02:47.050
What should I do from now on?

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.738
‘Tears make people stronger’ was nothing but sophism

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.850
Yes,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.607
it’s not that I don’t care what happens to me,

00:02:55.607 --> 00:02:58.370
it’s just that reality is flickering,

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.749
And summer is far away.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.978
Is this really all right?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.840
Can I go on living like this?

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.578
Are you just going to tell me
‘only you can answer that’ or something?

00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:12.596
I just

00:03:12.596 --> 00:03:15.383
Want to close my eyes to the scent of summer.

00:03:15.383 --> 00:03:18.116
I want to feel the wind always.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.141
Is it selfish to just want to look at the blue sky?”

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.003
Is it selfish if I just want to know you?

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.992
