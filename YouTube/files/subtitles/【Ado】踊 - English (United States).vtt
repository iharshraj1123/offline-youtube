00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.277
Half-ass deserves a K.O.　　

00:00:03.277 --> 00:00:07.102
So be it, if you’re light-hearted

00:00:07.102 --> 00:00:09.147
Let’s get ready for the show

00:00:09.147 --> 00:00:12.231
Cry or laugh, just love me okay

00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:18.614
C’mon “Say No”, bring the bass

00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:24.232
Dunno what to say…Things tend to get boring

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:26.096
Lonely logic note

00:00:26.096 --> 00:00:27.948
Handy serious escape

00:00:27.948 --> 00:00:30.000
Can’t take this anymore

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Bad taboo, but

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Drown and drop in mud

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.710
It’s ‘bout time

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.712
Let’s work harder

00:00:36.712 --> 00:00:38.712
Let’s work harder until I get excited

00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:40.873
Let’s connect, two is better that one

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:43.184
More the people, more I’m relieved

00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:45.272
Alright let me do it, Don’t mind

00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:46.931
If we all ride the waves of problems,

00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:49.395
Perhaps it’s easy to solve

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:52.082
Half-ass deserves a K.O.

00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:55.585
So be it, if you’re light-hearted

00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:58.000
Let’s get ready for the show

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.966
Cry or laugh, just love me okay

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:05.126
C’mon “Say No”, bring the bass

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:13.345
Tonight’s a party in the dark

00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:16.476
Woah

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.476
Dance, Dance

00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:19.757
Sanitize loneliness

00:01:19.757 --> 00:01:20.637
Full house, thank you

00:01:20.637 --> 00:01:24.236
Woah

00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:25.906
Even the pain, Let’s share it

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:27.906
It’s time to say bye-bye, let go

00:01:44.113 --> 00:01:48.551
Any complex, With a free-style platelet

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:51.860
Hold it, shove it, Take it away

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.771
Pumped up and down, Pretty much stressed out

00:01:55.771 --> 00:02:00.444
Spit it out at once, Give yourself away

00:02:00.444 --> 00:02:02.500
“Not really interested”

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500
“Don’t really care”

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.208
Forget these feelings, Ima say what I want

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:11.648
Send signal, PrrPrrPrr

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:15.526
Let’s come together, live the night

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.587
We be roaring

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.320
Half-ass deserves a K.O.

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:56.678
Woah

00:02:56.678 --> 00:02:58.131
Dance, Dance

00:02:58.131 --> 00:02:59.154
Sanitize loneliness

00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:00.180
Full house, thank you

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.500
Woah

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.500
Even the pain, Let’s share it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.447
Tonight’s a party in the dark

00:03:07.447 --> 00:03:10.982
Woah

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:15.107
We look forward to serving you again, perhaps

00:03:15.107 --> 00:03:18.400
Woah

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.108
Please take care until next time, It’s time to say bye-bye, let go
