00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.500
Hey Buddy

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.020
look at where you hear the clap from

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.840
and ollie that way together with the word “STOP”

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.260
The step you jumped over and land

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.640
with the beat 1, 2, 3

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.760
and a airplane takes off

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.540
Taking the timing(rhythm) on the player

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.460
It’s like a one scene from a movie

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.600
The midmost of the sun Fuwari

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.160
It seems to be going for a cloud
and a wonderland somehow

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.220
Boringly smashing buttons in QTE

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.660
The daily life that you care too much
about someone listening to you
in Kick it

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.300
Can’t wait till the pay day

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.480
because of how it’s terribly hot YA

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.420
In this scorching(KANKAN) sky

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.280
it’s best to listen some intense(KINKIN) rock

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.020
A day that you only do what you want to do

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.060
It’s not bad to have a such day too

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.220
Let’s leave out the diligentness for now

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.100
Put back your pen and oh yeah

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.180
oh yeah

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.400
The make-up exam is after having some tan

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.600
This sunshine that lights up the best day ever

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.600
Say bye bye to any nonsense for now

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.680
Say KANPAI(Cheers) even if you’re tired or lively!

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.400
Let’s play in a way that they won’t notice

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.620
The secret watchword is “YY”

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.620
Let’s work diligent One Life

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.500
Huh? Oh well… that doesn’t make any sense

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.100
It’s lit Only “now” is not enough

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.600
A summer storia

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.580
will begin dance again
once you get back ride on waves

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.200
No one cares what’s fair argument or who’s greater for now

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.080
The moment that feel so good

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.100
Swimming to the orange

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.980
A hot shower on the tanned skin and the tangled hairs

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.920
A gentle breeze and sunflowers

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.920
Yura Yura

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.240
Diving deep

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.500
In afternoon while swimming gracefully low

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.020
“Yes, I’m going now…”

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.040
That’s never gonna happen

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.620
No worries, it’s not a big deal

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.640
Uh-oh — Well, whatever

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.280
CITTA Sitting down right here

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.920
and taking a nap

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.920
That’s not bad I guess

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.320
and the voice fades out

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.300
September begins
even while in this summer heat

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.960
In this still bursting summer heat
our summer is still not over

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.880
Let’s leave out the diligentness for now

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.760
Put back your pen and oh yeah

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.820
oh yeah

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.340
This sunshine that lights up the best day ever

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.240
Say bye bye to any nonsense for now

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.280
Say KANPAI(Cheers) even you’re tired or lively!

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.100
Let’s play in a way that they won’t notice

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.100
The secret watchword is “YY”

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200
Let’s work diligent One Life

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.100
Huh? Oh well… that doesn’t make any sense

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.700
It’s lit Only “now” is not enough

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.200
A summer storia

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.800
will begin dance again
once you get back ride on waves
