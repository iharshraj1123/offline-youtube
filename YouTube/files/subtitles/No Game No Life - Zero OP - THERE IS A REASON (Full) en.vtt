00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.920
How far back should I begin this story?

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.280
Though even if you get tired of listening

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.120
I won't let you tell me it's over

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.560
I bring with me an unconscious impulse that I scribbled down-

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.380
If everything ends up broken

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.820
I can begin again form the impossible

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.900
There's a reason that we came across in this world

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.720
There's a reason that we caught a magnetic wave

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.480
As we hurt one another, where is this world headed?

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.700
So, the reason i cry for the sake of love

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.140
Is because you're right here

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.440
And I'll continue calling out to only you

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.940
The reason I sing for the sake of love

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.000
And the fact we will keep surviving together

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.380
Is because I'm always...with you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:50.200
I looked to the blue sky, and the sea below looked like

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.380
A serene mirror

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.400
No matter where you are

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.940
No matter what form you take

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.340
No matter what era you're in

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.180
I'll find you

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.620
So, shall we?

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.900
Let's oppose this fate hanging in midair

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.540
There's a reason that we came across in this world

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.620
There's a reason that we caught a magnetic wave

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.560
Pulled toward one another, where are we headed?

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.500
So, the reason i carry on for the sake of love

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.320
Is because you're right here with me

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.320
And I'll continue protecting only you

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.940
The reason I wish for the sake of love

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.460
And the fact no one will be hurt by it

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.280
Is because you're always...by my side

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.300
We'll overcome all of this world's hatred

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:33.540
So abandon all you false justice!

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.560
So, the reason I cry for the sake of love

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.680
Is because you're right here

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:52.720
We'll always be together

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.140
The reason...the reason I carry on for the sake of love

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.060
Is because you're right here with me

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.060
And I'll continue protecting only you

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.480
The reason I wish for the sake of love

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.040
And the fact we'll keep surviving together

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.440
Is because we'll always...

00:04:21,760 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
We'll always be together
