00:00:02.092 --> 00:00:05.483
I went home because you didnt give me a call

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:09.501
Just tell me I'm the only one, shit like that

00:00:10.148 --> 00:00:13.453
I loved because I wanted to wander

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:17.805
Da di la di la ta ta la la

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.408
Love seemed somewhat familiar

00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:41.909
So I drew a flower

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:46.443
Because I grew up too fast

00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:50.811
I was playing around with my sexuality

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:54.863
Here and there, I let my body go with the flow

00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:58.798
But I'm still nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

00:00:58.798 --> 00:01:03.000
This loud, loud, loud and frivolous heart of mine

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Who could ever notice it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.114
I cried because I don't give a f*ck

00:01:10.114 --> 00:01:13.775
Hold me and my confused heart

00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:17.646
Just give me something in return

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:22.107
Da di la di la ta ta la la

00:01:22.107 --> 00:01:25.769
Yeah yeah yeah yeah I forgot

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:30.000
Don't feel a thing

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.147
Yeah yeah yeah yeah I forgot

00:01:34.147 --> 00:01:37.649
Because I lost you

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.599
Go ahead and take me out

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.229
Makes me hurt, Tokyo sound

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.602
I hate the city

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.466
Tempers are short and everybody's cold

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:47.328
Everything is busy and lovely

00:01:47.328 --> 00:01:51.149
Pale and sallow but I'm high

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.007
Anybody's here but nobody's here

00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:58.964
Where where where is it

00:01:58.964 --> 00:02:03.000
I can't find gratitude or love in anything I do

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.154
Time and time and time again I keep thinking about it

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:10.311
The day I cried because of malice

00:02:10.311 --> 00:02:13.702
When the windy night is over

00:02:13.702 --> 00:02:17.744
And your scent is gone

00:02:17.744 --> 00:02:21.491
What will I do when I'm by myself

00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:25.866
Da di la di la ta ta la la

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:29.725
I cried because you didnt give me a call

00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:33.743
I went home because I only want you

00:02:33.743 --> 00:02:37.786
I loved because I wanted to be loved

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:42.136
Da di la di la ta ta la la

00:02:42.136 --> 00:02:46.142
Yeah yeah yeah yeah I forgot

00:02:46.142 --> 00:02:50.148
Don't feel a thing

00:02:50.148 --> 00:02:53.723
Yeah yeah yeah yeah I forgot

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:58.042
Because I lost you
