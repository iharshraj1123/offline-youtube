00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.601
Bloom all over in the indigo of the night, the reason to live

00:00:04.618 --> 00:00:08.614
Let your scars, lies, and pain become poetry

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:12.166
What can I save by writing about my dreams and love?

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.604
Be the light that dyes the gloomy sky

00:00:21.057 --> 00:00:35.498
Ikiru yosuga (Reason For Existence)

00:00:35.498 --> 00:00:43.362
A trite form of happiness in this world, That's not enough to fill the void

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:50.735
I'm a liar saying I'm alive, With this heart like a machine

00:00:50.757 --> 00:00:53.921
Can't do, can't understand, can't change

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:57.358
Words become worthless tones

00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:01.757
Can't be satisfied, can't be fulfilled, With a song like this

00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:05.298
Oh I can't light up anyone's heart

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.273
Tear up and slash the sorrow of the night, the reason to live

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:12.939
Let your mistakes, answers, today and future become poetry

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:16.886
Can you hear this voice I’m playing now?

00:01:16.886 --> 00:01:20.917
It’s the foolish cry from stupid me

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:24.441
Please give this life

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:28.335
A reason to live tomorrow

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:32.219
Please find me

00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:37.796
The midday moon that is certainly there

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:59.482
My throat hurts as I swallowed the words, What is this getting stuck in my chest?

00:01:59.507 --> 00:02:06.948
I looked up at the darkness that swallowed my heart, I reach for the glowing red

00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:14.773
Not everything will be rewarded, Even time and money might be wasted

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:17.435
Someday everything will fade into the past

00:02:17.455 --> 00:02:25.786
Still I sing because I was born here

00:02:37.303 --> 00:02:44.014
Just being right cannot save everything

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.289
If not crying is the way to be strong

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:52.000
I'll just stay weak

00:02:52.068 --> 00:02:55.916
Tear up and slash the sorrow of the night, the reason to live

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:59.542
Let your mistakes, answers, today and future become poetry

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:03.547
I don't know, I don't know about our ability or life

00:03:03.547 --> 00:03:07.201
Even if it's full of lies, But still

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.012
Live 

00:03:08.012 --> 00:03:11.198
Night ends without love or anything else

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:14.901
The reason you were born can be added afterwards

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.775
When dying, never call it beauty

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:22.653
There's no flower that blooms to fall

00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:30.000
Fill up something uglily beautiful, And my missing heart

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:34.032
With what songs, what words

00:03:34.032 --> 00:03:39.751
Can I become the reason of the dark night?

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:53.241
I wish for only one thing from God
