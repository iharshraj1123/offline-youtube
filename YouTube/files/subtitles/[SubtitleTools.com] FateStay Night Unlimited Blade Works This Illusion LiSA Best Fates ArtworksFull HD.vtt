00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.300
I have seen it in my dreams

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.710
even in the shadows

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.710
the cries that don't reach them

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780
The me of tomorrow

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.100
No matter how hard I depict

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.650
is drenched in desires that won't disappear

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.580
Catching the falling pieces

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.510
with these hands of mine

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.450
and holding my swaying heart

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:14.710
I leap into the night

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.200
Even though I depend on someone

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.710
there is nothing else that I wish for

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.700
My true self is right here

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.000
don't close your eyes

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.900
Blown in the wind

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.680
like a discarded junk

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.900
that nostalgic smile

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.200
No matter how I pray

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.100
for the me of tomorrow

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.800
those distant answers are fading

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.450
This frozen body and

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.200
this fragment of feeling

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.510
before they rot away

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.850
leap past the night

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.330
Even though I depend on someone

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.700
there is nothing else I desire

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.700
My true self is right here

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.300
don't close your eyes

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.400
To live for the sake of others

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.750
this moment may count for everything

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.750
gently cast aside your fake self

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:49.500
and just be who you are
