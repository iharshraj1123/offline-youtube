00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:04.620
The moon is rising again,

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:08.825
and today is beginning to end

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:12.662
I’m gulping down

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:16.700
the words of wishes I’ve made

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.704
Bursting into tears on a Friday night,

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:24.741
but you’ll still be okay

00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:28.578
Run now, run

00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:32.916
If you want to change tomorrow,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.920
in that case, in that case…

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:40.010
Not yet, not yet, not yet

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.661
It’s making another round on the night sky

00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:48.865
It waxes and wanes, and gets washed away

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:52.472
I can’t laugh

00:00:52.472 --> 00:00:56.540
if all I ever do is to watch the time

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.490
The sky rabbit is spinning around

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.570
You equal tomorrow

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.538
Don’t lose against tomorrow

00:01:08.538 --> 00:01:12.522
I don’t want to turn my back on it,

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.959
that’s why, that’s why

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:20.030
Right now, right now…

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.603
I aimed for the distant moon

00:01:26.603 --> 00:01:28.371
The sky today

00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:34.544
has been washed far away, to the west

00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:39.149
It’s beyond my reach

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.886
Beyond my reach…

00:01:52.327 --> 00:01:58.468
My tears have soaked the night

00:01:58.468 --> 00:02:00.237
The sky today

00:02:00.237 --> 00:02:06.409
has been washed far away, to the night

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.494
“Don’t cry anymore”

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:14.651
I aimed for the distant moon

00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:16.386
The sky today

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:23.160
brought forth a rain of many stars

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.230
This isn’t a dream!

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.401
It’s not a dream…

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:45.015
