00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:11.136
All you guys wanna do is

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:13.304
label, discriminate, divide

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:16.850
For some reason, humans have this habit to categorize

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.269
There's only two kinds of people in this world,

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.354
Those who say this, you're my target

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.356
The haves and the have nots

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.483
The doers and the don'ters

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:26.484
Are you Ying or Yang?

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:29.320
You can't relax unless you fit us in a box

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.156
Not noticing what's outside your instincts

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.491
Wanna take a peek? Not in the mood?

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.454
In other words, it's not so simple

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:41.458
Something more ambiguous, delicate, and obscure

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.626
Like the one who can't bring it out, but has it

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.336
The one who isn't cool, but doing it

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:47.130
The one who pretends to get it, but got it

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.758
and becoming nervous as they fake it

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.551
After all, you're gifted

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.261
You say you're an ordinary housewife

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:55.638
Isn't that good? Isn't it wonderful?

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:58.016
Did you just prove the impossible?

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:01.269
I'm not saying you need a dream

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:05.982
But it won't make you irresponsible

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:09.527
Just don't get eaten by that habit

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:15.992
Each habit you rid, your value is revealed

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.871
We're animals too

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.664
This is what I love

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:23.750
How do you feel now?

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.419
You should feel the laughter building

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.837
We're animals too

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.256
Hence this original habit we possess

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.425
Don't categorize you yourself

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.636
Try and break that bad habit

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.602
Try and break that bad habit

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.071
Let me tell you something

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.864
No decent grownup would admit to but

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.783
Truth be told, preaching is a pleasure

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.660
Goes down so well with booze

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.246
And if that spurs you into action

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.872
Then everyone wins, right?

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.041
Although it's a shame too

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.001
For starters, it's all up to you

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.045
And I really don't care what you end up doing

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:10.755
So what now for you?

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:12.841
Just by having been asked

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.260
I wanna believe it isn't over

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.137
If not, it's one hell of an emergency

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.721
Because you guys were categorized

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:21.057
in an ordinary suffocating box

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:23.184
My life is on easy-mode

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.103
Just sleeping there, now almost 30

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:27.063
I'm no catch to begin with

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:29.482
So I clawed, flailed and wailed

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.359
If you were to categorize my old self

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.319
it would be obvious to anyone

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.238
The world only cares about money

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.365
love, luck, fate

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:40.160
How can it be so simple?

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:45.039
We're more ambiguous,

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:49.502
something complex and obscure

00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:53.673
Don't pretend to know,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.721
you don't have the ability to categorize yourself

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.474
We're animals too

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:05.476
This is what I love

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.228
How do you feel now?

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:10.106
You should feel the laughter building

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:11.566
We're animals too

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:13.776
Hence this original habit we possess

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:16.029
Don't categorize you yourself

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.114
Try and break that bad habit

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.049
We're animals too

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.092
This is what I love

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.886
How do you feel now?

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.764
You should feel the laughter building

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.182
We're animals too

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.476
Hence this original habit we possess

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.603
Don't categorize yourself

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.855
Try and break that bad habit

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.030
Try and break that bad habit
