"Glasses"
Music & Lyrics by Ultra-Noob

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.820
To wash my face

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.820
Glasses I put on the desk

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.840
Those you're touching in fun

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.960
Are my glasses

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.700
Your finger dancing on the clear lens

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.220
Left snow footprints

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.440
On the stage of clean glass

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.700
Your fingertip in my glasses

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.920
Snatches my sight

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.680
Your magic in my glasses

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.940
Blocks my way

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.980
That's right

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.700
Your fingertip in my glasses

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.720
Snatches my heart

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.720
With your fantasy in my glasses

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.440
I'm satisfied

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.800
Coffee you squirted out

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.800
Twinkled with the sunlight

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.700
Like countless lenses

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.480
And poured into my face

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.720
Your fingertip in my glasses

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.940
Snatches my sight

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.740
Your magic in my glasses

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.960
Blocks my way

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.980
That's right

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.680
Your fingertip in my glasses

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.700
Snatches my heart

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.700
With your fantasy in my glasses

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.960
I'm satisfied
