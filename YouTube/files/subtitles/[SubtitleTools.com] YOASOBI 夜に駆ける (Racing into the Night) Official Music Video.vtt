00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.320 line:-2
Just like I'm about to sink

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.020 line:-2
Just like I'm about to melt

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.540 line:-2
Only the two of us at that night on the vast sky

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.780 line:-2
It was only a simple "goodbye"

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.560 line:-2
But it was all I needed to understand.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.400 line:-2
The sinking sun, the rising night sky

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.900 line:-2
overlaps with your figure behind the fence

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.780 line:-2
Ever since the first day we met

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.400 line:-2
You stole my heart

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.100 line:-2
Like you were wrapped in fragile air

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.010 line:-2
You had a lonely gaze

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.020 line:-2
Again and again in the world always ringing with "tick-tocks"

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.800 line:-2
Touching the heartless words and loud voices

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.600 line:-2
even if tears are about to spill

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.700 line:-2
if it were the two of us together

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.520 line:-2
I'm sure mundane happiness could be found

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.880 line:-2
In the troubling days, for the never-smiling you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.980 line:-2
I give my utmost love in hopes for the dazzling tomorrow

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.460 line:-2
In the never ending night before we fall

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.380 line:-2
come and take my hand

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.780 line:-2
Even the days that you hid inside, wanting to forget

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.300 line:-2
I'll melt with the warmth of my embraces

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.920 line:-2
No need to be afraid, until dawn comes someday

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.800 line:-2
Let's be together

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.500 line:-2
I hate it when you stare at the things only you can see

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.200 line:-2
Like you're captivated by it

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.850 line:-2
Or you're in love

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.530 line:-2
I hate that expression

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.980 line:-2
The things I want to believe but I can't

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.720 line:-2
No matter what I do

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.640 line:-2
They'll repeatedly appear and every time I'll get angry and cry

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.220 line:-2
Even so, some day we'll surely

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.700 line:-2
We'll understand each other

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.200 line:-2
I believe in it

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.340 line:-2
"I don't want this, I'm tired of it"

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.500 line:-2
I frantically reach for your hand

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.000 line:-2
but you push my hands away

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.500 line:-2
"I don't want this, I'm tired of it"

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.400 line:-2
To tell the truth, I want to say that too

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.240 line:-2
In the world ringing with "tick-tock"s, again and again

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.640 line:-2
none of the words I've prepared for you  reached you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.000 line:-2
"I want to end it all"

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.940 line:-2
When I went along and said that

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.940 line:-2
You smiled for the first time

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.400 line:-2
In the troubling days I became unable to smile

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.980 line:-2
The reflection of you in my eyes is truly beautiful

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000 line:-2
The overflowing tears on the never-ending night

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.220 line:-2
all dissolve into your smile

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000 line:-2
In the never-changing days when I cried

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.640 line:-2
You seduce me with your tenderness towards the end

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.320 line:-2
Just like I'm about to sink

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.380 line:-2
Just I'm about to melt

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.280 line:-2
the staining fog dissipates

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.760 line:-2
In the days that I hide inside wanting to forget

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.600 line:-2
I take your hand as you extend it towards me

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.500 line:-2
It's like the cold breeze is swimming through the sky

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.500 line:-2
blowing through us

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.600 line:-2
Don't ever let go of my hand

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.080 line:-2
The both of us, racing into the night
