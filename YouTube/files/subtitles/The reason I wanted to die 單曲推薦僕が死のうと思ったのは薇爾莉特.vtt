00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.920
The reason I wanted to die,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.680
was that seagulls were squawking down by the wharf.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.060
They floated off at the mercy of the waves.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.280
Peck away at my past, too, before you fly off.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.740
The reason I wanted to die,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.540
was that our apricot tree blossomed on my birthday.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.020
When I dozed off in its dappled sunlight,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.340
I wondered if I could join all the dead bugs and return to dust.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.600
Peppermint candy. The lamplight of a fishing harbour.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.620
A rusted arch bridge. A discarded bicycle.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.740
In front of a stove in a wooden station building,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.460
but there's nowhere my heart can embark.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.020
Today was exactly the same as yesterday.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.180
''If you want to change tomorrow you have to change today!''

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.420
I get that. I get it. But still...

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.520
The reason I wanted to die,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.200
was that my heart had become hollow.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.460
The reason I cry about how unsatisfied I am,

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.560
is surely because I'm wishing for fulfillment.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.000
The reason I wanted to die,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.900
was that my shoelaces had come untied.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.020
I was never really that good at re-tying them.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.240
My relationships with others are same way, too.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.880
The reason I wanted to die,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.720
was that a teenager was staring right at me.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.120
And now I'm prostrated atop my bed,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.200
apologizing to my younger self.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.860
The dim light of the computer.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.660
The ambient noise from the floors above.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.560
A bird-caged boy,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.560
plugging his ears to block out the interphone chime.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.200
I'm fighting with an enemy I can't even see,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.420
like I'm Don Quixote in this 10x10 bedroom.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.680
And in the end, what I'm fighting for is a truly unseemly thing.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.640
The reason I wanted to die,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.320
was that I was called a cold-hearted person.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.460
The reason I cry that I long to be loved,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.620
is that can't unlearn the warmth of another person's touch.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.180
The reason I wanted to die,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.920
was that you smile so beautifully.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.140
The reason I can't stop thinking about death,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.380
must be that I take living too seriously.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.080
The reason I wanted to die,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.920
was that I still hadn't met you yet!

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.280
If the world has people like you in it,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.340
then I like the world a little bit more.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.560
If the world has people like you in it,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.000
then I have a little bit more hope for the world.
