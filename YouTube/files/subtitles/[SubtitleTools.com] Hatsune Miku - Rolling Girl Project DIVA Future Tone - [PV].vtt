"Rolling Girl"
Music & Lyrics by wowaka

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.320
For lonely girls, it's always the same

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.560
Dreaming dreams that don't come true

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.860
And churning, churning through

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.240
The clamor in their heads

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.860
A lonely girl mutters "I'm fine"

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.060
Have words failed her?

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.400
A failure, a failure

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.920
Obsessing over her mistakes makes everything spin again!

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.240
One more time, one more time

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.840
"I'll roll along again today"

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.200
The girl said, the girl said

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.760
Breathing life into the words!

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.840
"How about now?"

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.700
"Not yet, we still can't see what's ahead.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.740
Hold your breath, now."

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.060
This is how it ends for a Rolling Girl

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.340
Unable to reach the colors on the other side

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.640
The overlapping voices

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.180
They blend together, blend together

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:23.020
She mutters, "I'm fine.", but the words fail her

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.320
Not caring how it ends

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.420
An upward climb that invites mistakes

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.200
One more time, one more time

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.780
Please, get me rolling

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.120
The girl said, the girl said

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.740
With her intense silence!

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.780
"How about now?"

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.700
"Just a little more, we should see something soon.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.560
Hold your breath, now."

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.880
One more time, one more time

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.480
"I'll roll along again today"

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.780
The girl said, the girl said

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.420
Breathing laughter into the words!

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.720
"How about now? OK, you can look.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.340
You must be exhausted too, right?"

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.440
Stop breathing, now.
